<seg id="1">I'm Sam, and I just turned 17.</seg>
<seg id="2">A few years ago, before my freshman year in High School, I wanted to play snare drum in the Foxboro High School Marching Band, and it was a dream that I just had to accomplish.</seg>
<seg id="3">But each snare drum and harness weighed about 40 pounds each, and I have a disease called Progeria.</seg>
<seg id="4">So just to give you an idea, I weigh only about 50 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="5">So, logistically, I really couldn't carry a regular sized snare drum, and because of this the band director assigned me to play pit percussion during the halftime show.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now pit percussion was fun.</seg>
<seg id="7">It involved some really cool auxiliary percussion instruments, like the bongos, timpani, and timbales, and cowbell.</seg>
<seg id="8">So it was fun, but it involved no marching, and I was just so devastated.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, nothing was going to stop me from playing snare drum with the marching band in the halftime show.</seg>
<seg id="10">So my family and I worked with an engineer to design a snare drum harness that would be lighter, and easier for me to carry.</seg>
<seg id="11">So after continuous work, we made a snare drum apparatus that weighs only about 6 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="12">I just want to give you some more information about Progeria.</seg>
<seg id="13">It affects only about 350 kids today, worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="14">So it's pretty rare, and the effects of Progeria include: tight skin, lack of weight gain, stunted growth, and heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year my Mom and her team of scientists published the first successful Progeria Treatment Study, and because of this I was interviewed on NPR, and John Hamilton asked me the question: "What is the most important thing that people should know about you?"</seg>
<seg id="16">And my answer was simply that I have a very happy life.</seg>
<seg id="17">So even though there are many obstacles in my life, with a lot of them being created by Progeria, I don't want people to feel bad for me.</seg>
<seg id="18">I don't think about these obstacles all the time, and I'm able to overcome most of them anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">So I’m here today, to share with you my philosophy for a happy life.</seg>
<seg id="20">So, for me, there are 3 aspects to this philosophy.</seg>
<seg id="21">So this is a quote from the famous Ferris Bueller.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first aspect to my philosophy is that I’m okay with what I ultimately can’t do because there is so much I can do.</seg>
<seg id="23">Now people sometimes ask me questions like, "Isn’t it hard living with Progeria?" or "What daily challenges of Progeria do you face?"</seg>
<seg id="24">And I’d like to say that, even though I have Progeria, most of my time is spent thinking about things that have nothing to do with Progeria at all.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now this doesn’t mean that I ignore the negative aspects of these obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="26">When I can’t do something like run a long distance, or go on an intense roller coaster, I know what I’m missing out on.</seg>
<seg id="27">But instead, I choose to focus on the activities that I can do through things that I’m passionate about, like scouting, or music, or comic books, or any of my favorite Boston sports teams.</seg>
<seg id="28">Yeah, so -- However, sometimes I need to find a different way to do something by making adjustments, and I want to put those things in the "can do" category.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kind of like you saw with the drum earlier.</seg>
<seg id="30">So here’s a clip with me playing Spider-Man with the Foxboro High School Marching Band at halftime a couple of years ago.</seg>
<seg id="31">All right, all right, so -- That was pretty cool, and so I was able to accomplish my dream of playing snare drum with the marching band, as I believe I can do for all of my dreams.</seg>
<seg id="32">So hopefully, you can accomplish your dreams as well, with this outlook.</seg>
<seg id="33">The next aspect to my philosophy is that I surround myself with people I want to be with, people of high quality.</seg>
<seg id="34">I’m extremely lucky to have an amazing family, who have always supported me throughout my entire life.</seg>
<seg id="35">And I’m also really fortunate to have a really close group of friends at school.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now we’re kind of goofy, a lot of us are band geeks, but we really enjoy each other’s company, and we help each other out when we need to.</seg>
<seg id="37">We see each other for who we are on the inside.</seg>
<seg id="38">So this is us goofing off a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="39">So we’re juniors in High School now, and we can now mentor younger band members, as a single collective unit.</seg>
<seg id="40">What I love about being in a group like the band, is that the music that we make together, is true, is genuine, and it supersedes Progeria.</seg>
<seg id="41">So I don’t have to worry about that when I’m feeling so good about making music.</seg>
<seg id="42">But even having made a documentary, going on TV a couple of times, I feel like I’m at my highest point when I’m with the people that surround me every day.</seg>
<seg id="43">They provide the real positive influences in my life, as I hope I can provide a positive influence in theirs as well.</seg>
<seg id="44">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="45">So the bottom line here, is that I hope you appreciate and love your family, love your friends, for you guys, love you Bro’s and acknowledge your mentors, and your community, because they are a very real aspect of everyday life, they can make a truly significant, positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="46">The third aspect to the philosophy is, Keep moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="47">Here’s a quote by a man you may know, named Walt Disney, and it’s one of my favorite quotes.</seg>
<seg id="48">I always try to have something to look forward to.</seg>
<seg id="49">Something to strive for to make my life richer.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn’t have to be big.</seg>
<seg id="51">It could be anything from looking forward to the next comic book to come out, or going on a large family vacation, or hanging out with my friends, to going to the next High School football game.</seg>
<seg id="52">However, all of these things keep me focused, and know that there’s a bright future ahead, and may get me through some difficult times that I may be having.</seg>
<seg id="53">Now this mentality includes staying in a forward thinking state of mind.</seg>
<seg id="54">I try hard not to waste energy feeling badly for myself, because when I do, I get stuck in a paradox, where there’s no room for any happiness or any other emotion.</seg>
<seg id="55">Now, it’s not that I ignore when I’m feeling badly, I kind of accept it, I let it in, so that I can acknowledge it, and do what I need to do to move past it.</seg>
<seg id="56">When I was younger, I wanted to be an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="57">I wanted to be an inventor, who would catapult the world into a better future.</seg>
<seg id="58">Maybe this came from my love of Legos, and the freedom of expression that I felt when I was building with them.</seg>
<seg id="59">And this was also derived from my family and my mentors, who always make me feel whole, and good about myself.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now today my ambitions have changed a little bit, I’d like to go into the field of Biology, maybe cell biology, or genetics, or biochemistry, or really anything.</seg>
<seg id="61">This is a friend of mine, who I look up to, Francis Collins, the director of the NIH, and this is us at TEDMED last year, chatting away.</seg>
<seg id="62">I feel that no matter what I choose to become, I believe that I can change the world.</seg>
<seg id="63">And as I’m striving to change the world, I will be happy.</seg>
<seg id="64">About four years ago, HBO began to film a documentary about my family and me called “Life According to Sam”.</seg>
<seg id="65">That was a pretty great experience, but it was also four years ago.</seg>
<seg id="66">And like anyone, my views on many things have changed, and hopefully matured, like my potential career choice.</seg>
<seg id="67">However, some things have stayed the same throughout that time.</seg>
<seg id="68">Like my mentality, and philosophy towards life.</seg>
<seg id="69">So I would like to show you a clip of my younger self from the film, that I feel embodies that philosophy.</seg>
<seg id="70">I know more about it genetically.</seg>
<seg id="71">So it’s less of an embodiment now.</seg>
<seg id="72">It used to be like this thing that prevents me from doing all this stuff, that causes other kids to die, that causes everybody to be stressed, and now it’s a protein that is abnormal, that weakens the structure of cells.</seg>
<seg id="73">So, and it takes a burden off of me because now I don’t have to think about Progeria as an entity.</seg>
<seg id="74">Okay, pretty good, huh?</seg>
<seg id="75">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="76">So, as you can see I’ve been thinking this way for many years.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I’d never really had to apply all of these aspects of my philosophy to the test at one time, until last January.</seg>
<seg id="78">I was pretty sick, I had a chest cold, and I was in the hospital for a few days, and I was secluded from all of the aspects of my life that I felt made me, me, that kind of gave me my identity.</seg>
<seg id="79">But knowing that I was going to get better, and looking forward to a time that I would feel good again, helped me to keep moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="80">And sometimes I had to be brave, and it wasn’t always easy.</seg>
<seg id="81">Sometimes I faltered, I had bad days, but I realized that being brave isn’t supposed to be easy.</seg>
<seg id="82">And for me, I feel it’s the key way to keep moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="83">So, all in all, I don’t waste energy feeling bad for myself.</seg>
<seg id="84">I surround myself with people that I want to be with, and I keep moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="85">So with this philosophy, I hope that all of you, regardless of your obstacles, can have a very happy life as well.</seg>
<seg id="86">Oh, wait, hang on a second, one more piece of advice –-</seg>
<seg id="87">Never miss a party if you can help it.</seg>
<seg id="88">My school’s homecoming dance is tomorrow night, and I will be there.</seg>
<seg id="89">Thank you very much.</seg>

<seg id="1">Translator: Romina Meffe Reviewer: Denise RQ You are bold, you are brilliant, and you are beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="2">There is no other woman like you.</seg>
<seg id="3">You are capable.</seg>
<seg id="4">Back fat, I see you popping over my bra today, but that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="5">I'm going to choose to love you.</seg>
<seg id="6">And thick thighs, you are just so sexy, you can't stop rubbing each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">That's alright. I'm going to keep you.</seg>
<seg id="8">And cellulite, I have not forgotten about you.</seg>
<seg id="9">I'm going to choose to love you even though you want to take over my whole bottom half, but you're a part of me.</seg>
<seg id="10">I love you.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's true, honestly.</seg>
<seg id="12">I felt free once I realized I was never going to fit the narrow mold that society wanted me to fit in.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was never going to be perfect enough for an industry that defines perfection from the outside in.</seg>
<seg id="14">And that's OK.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rolls, curves, cellulite, all of it.</seg>
<seg id="16">I love every part of me.</seg>
<seg id="17">My name is Ashley Graham, and I'm a model and body activist.</seg>
<seg id="18">Over the last 15 years, I've come to the conclusion that there is no one perfect body.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because I, like you, possess a wonderfully unique and diverse physique.</seg>
<seg id="20">Now, the fashion industry may persist to label me as "plus size", but I like to think of it as 'my size'.</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, did you know that the plus size fashion industry actually starts at a US size 8?</seg>
<seg id="22">And it goes up to a US size 16.</seg>
<seg id="23">So basically what I'm saying is that the majority of this room right now is considered plus size.</seg>
<seg id="24">How does it make you feel to be labeled?</seg>
<seg id="25">I really feel like we need to start looking beyond the plus size model paradigms to what it actually means to be a model in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="26">My journey begins in Lincoln, Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="27">I was 12 years old and scouted in a mall.</seg>
<seg id="28">At 13, I signed with a major modeling agency and was traveling the world.</seg>
<seg id="29">I was shooting big campaigns, and before I even graduated high school, I had been to multiple different countries.</seg>
<seg id="30">At 17, I graduated and moved to New York, and while most kids are going through their self-discovery stage in college, my self discovery stage was in the midst of catwalks, catalogs, and casting calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">I was working as a full time plus size model.</seg>
<seg id="32">Back in Nebraska, I was known as the "Fat Model".</seg>
<seg id="33">The girl who is pretty for a big girl.</seg>
<seg id="34">I always hated answering that question: "What do you do for a living?"</seg>
<seg id="35">I would see that person's eyebrow raise as I would reply: "I'm a model!"</seg>
<seg id="36">I'd have to quickly qualify with: "Well, I'm a plus size model."</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, here is my very first editorial for YM Magazine.</seg>
<seg id="38">And, you are reading it correctly, "cantaloupes-large breasts".</seg>
<seg id="39">I was helping women across America at the age of 15 dress their big boobs.</seg>
<seg id="40">But you know what the first thing that someone in middle school pointed out to me besides-- well, besides the obvious?</seg>
<seg id="41">Was that fold above my knee.</seg>
<seg id="42">That fat fold above my knee.</seg>
<seg id="43">As a young model, my confidence was tugged at and pulled in all different directions.</seg>
<seg id="44">I struggled to achieve true confidence.</seg>
<seg id="45">I would go home and look in front of the mirror and only hate what I saw.</seg>
<seg id="46">And to fill the void on the inside, I began to cave to all the vices being thrown my way.</seg>
<seg id="47">Between the parties, the men, the alcohol, I was looking for self love, for affirmation from somebody, when in reality, I didn't love who I was, and I couldn't seem to get a handle on regulating my own weight.</seg>
<seg id="48">I began to face my insecurities head on.</seg>
<seg id="49">And instead, I was filling my life with temporary fixes.</seg>
<seg id="50">I, like so many young women, have struggled to love who I am.</seg>
<seg id="51">And Dove's global report on attitudes towards beauty actually did a survey with thousands of women in ten different countries.</seg>
<seg id="52">And you know what the most striking result was?</seg>
<seg id="53">That only 2% of women find themselves beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="54">We need to work together to redefine the global vision of beauty.</seg>
<seg id="55">And it starts with becoming your own role model.</seg>
<seg id="56">As a curvy woman it was the assumption that I should look up to Marilyn Monroe or Jennifer Lopez mainly because they were two of the most notable curvy women in the public eye that were being praised for their curves.</seg>
<seg id="57">But these weren't my role models.</seg>
<seg id="58">In reality, the woman I looked up to the most was my mother.</seg>
<seg id="59">She told me I was beautiful, and she never devalued herself.</seg>
<seg id="60">So why would I?</seg>
<seg id="61">She told me and taught me that true beauty comes from within and that validation and self worth must also come from within.</seg>
<seg id="62">In my lowest moments of insecurity this is when I realized that I had to reclaim my body and its image as my own.</seg>
<seg id="63">Plus-size fashion is an 18-billion-dollar industry.</seg>
<seg id="64">And now IMG, the world's number one modeling agency, has signed me and other models that are not defined by their size.</seg>
<seg id="65">My body, like my confidence, has been picked apart, manipulated, and controlled by others who didn't necessarily understand it.</seg>
<seg id="66">I had to learn to reclaim my body as my own.</seg>
<seg id="67">And in reclaiming my body as my own, I understood as a woman that I had a greater purpose.</seg>
<seg id="68">I had a greater purpose to redefine beauty.</seg>
<seg id="69">The feminine beauty.</seg>
<seg id="70">Curvy models are becoming more and more vocal about the isolating nature of the term plus size.</seg>
<seg id="71">We are calling ourselves what we want to be called: women with shapes that are our own.</seg>
<seg id="72">I believe beauty is beyond size.</seg>
<seg id="73">With so much emphasis on the body and external, it's no wonder that we all suffer so much internally.</seg>
<seg id="74">But you know, people in the fashion industry actually told me that I would never be in magazines let alone the covers of them.</seg>
<seg id="75">Well, I guess we've proven them wrong.</seg>
<seg id="76">Five covers in a little over a year.</seg>
<seg id="77">And I was one of the very first curvy models to be featured in Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition.</seg>
<seg id="78">Never let anybody tell you that you can't.</seg>
<seg id="79">I have achieved, and I'm still achieving what was seemingly impossible.</seg>
<seg id="80">My goal is to give a voice to young women.</seg>
<seg id="81">To give a voice to young women who struggle to find someone they can look up to.</seg>
<seg id="82">For girls who struggle to look inside the mirror and say, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="83">For women who feel uncomfortable expressing their confidence they've locked away inside themselves.</seg>
<seg id="84">For women who have relinquished their rights to someone else.</seg>
<seg id="85">It is critical that both men and women create a body positive environment.</seg>
<seg id="86">Uplift the important women in your lives.</seg>
<seg id="87">Create a safe space for them to express their body and their beauty for who they are not because of who they're not.</seg>
<seg id="88">Be you. Be real. Be authentic.</seg>
<seg id="89">Be your favorite kind of woman.</seg>
<seg id="90">Don't let anybody else take that job.</seg>
<seg id="91">And remember this is the generation of body diversity.</seg>
<seg id="92">The current is changing.</seg>
<seg id="93">I now invite all of you to #TEDxBV15 with your own self-affirming words.</seg>
<seg id="94">There may not be a full-length mirror in front of each of you today, but I want to challenge you to think about what you would want to say to yourself in the mirror with your own self-affirming words.</seg>
<seg id="95">Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="1">Transcriber: Camille Martínez Reviewer: Judith Matz I'm really, really, really excited to be here.</seg>
<seg id="2">I kind of want to tell you a little bit more of the - I don't want to say basics - because we really don't know anything about my syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="3">I was born with this very rare syndrome, that only two other people in the world including myself, that we know of, have.</seg>
<seg id="4">Basically what this syndrome causes, is that I cannot gain weight.</seg>
<seg id="5">Yes, it does sound as good as it is.</seg>
<seg id="6">I could eat absolutely whatever I want, whenever I want and I won't really gain any weight.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm going to be 25 in March, and I've never weighed over about 64 pounds in my entire life.</seg>
<seg id="8">When I was in college, I hid - well, I didn't 'hide' it, everyone knew it was there - but it was a giant tub of Twinkies, donuts, chips, Skittles, and my roommate would say, "I could hear you at 12:30 am, reaching under your bed to get food."</seg>
<seg id="9">But I'm like, "You know what? It's alright, I can do these things!"</seg>
<seg id="10">Because there are benefits to this syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are benefits to not being able to gain weight.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are benefits to being visually impaired.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are benefits to being kind of really small.</seg>
<seg id="14">A lot of people think, "Lizzie, how in the world are you saying there are benefits when you can only see out of one eye?"</seg>
<seg id="15">Well, let me tell you what the benefits are because they are great.</seg>
<seg id="16">I wear contacts--conTACT. Half-off conTACTS.</seg>
<seg id="17">When I wear my reading glasses: half-off prescription.</seg>
<seg id="18">If somebody is annoying me, being rude: Stand on my right side.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's like you're not even there. I don't even know you're standing there.</seg>
<seg id="20">Right now, if I stand like this, I have no clue that there's this whole side of the room.</seg>
<seg id="21">Also, being small, I am very willing to volunteer myself to go to Weight Watchers or to some gym, and say, "Hi, I'm Lizzie. I will be your poster child. Put my face on whatever you need, and I will say, 'Hi! I used this program. Look how well it worked.'"</seg>
<seg id="22">Even though there are amazing things that have come from this syndrome, there are also things that have been very, very difficult, as you can imagine.</seg>
<seg id="23">Growing up, I was raised 150% normally.</seg>
<seg id="24">I was my parents' first child.</seg>
<seg id="25">And when I was born, the doctors told my mom, "Your daughter has no amniotic fluid around her. At all."</seg>
<seg id="26">So when I was born, it was a miracle that I came out screaming.</seg>
<seg id="27">The doctors told my parents, "We just want to warn you: Expect your daughter to never be able to talk, walk, crawl, think, or do anything by herself."</seg>
<seg id="28">Now, as first-time parents, you would think that my parents would say, "Oh no. Why? Why are we getting our first child with all these unknown problems?"</seg>
<seg id="29">But that's not what they did.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first thing they told the doctor was, "We want to see her, and we are going to take her home and love her, and raise her to the best of our abilities."</seg>
<seg id="31">And that's what they did.</seg>
<seg id="32">I credit pretty much everything that I've done in my life to my parents.</seg>
<seg id="33">My dad is here with me today, and my mom is at home watching.</seg>
<seg id="34">Hi mom! She's recovering from surgery.</seg>
<seg id="35">She has been the glue that's held our family together, and she's given me the strength to see that she's going through so much, but she has this fighting spirit that she's instilled in me, so that I have proudly been able to stand in front of people and say, "You know what? I've had a really difficult life. But that's okay."</seg>
<seg id="36">That's okay. Things have been scary, things have been tough.</seg>
<seg id="37">One of the biggest things that I had to deal with growing up was something I'm pretty sure every single one of us in this room has dealt with before.</seg>
<seg id="38">Can you guess what that is?</seg>
<seg id="39">It starts with a 'B'. Can you guys guess it?</seg>
<seg id="40">Audience: Boys! Lizzie: Boys?</seg>
<seg id="41">Bullying!</seg>
<seg id="42">I know what you all are thinking.</seg>
<seg id="43">Why can't I sit here with them? I had to deal with bullying a lot, but as I said, I was raised very normally, so when I started kindergarten, I had absolutely no idea that I looked different.</seg>
<seg id="44">No clue.</seg>
<seg id="45">I couldn't see that I looked different from other kids.</seg>
<seg id="46">I think of it as a big slap of reality for a five year-old, because I went in to school the first day, decked-out in Pocahontas gear.</seg>
<seg id="47">I was ready!</seg>
<seg id="48">I went in with my backpack that looked like a turtle shell because it was bigger than me, and I walked up to a little girl and smiled at her, and she looked up at me like I was a monster, like I was the scariest thing she had ever seen in her life.</seg>
<seg id="49">My first reaction was, "She is really rude.</seg>
<seg id="50">I am a fun kid, and she's the one missing out.</seg>
<seg id="51">So I'll just go over here and play with blocks. Or boys."</seg>
<seg id="52">I thought the day would get better, and unfortunately, it didn't.</seg>
<seg id="53">The day got worse and worse. A lot of people just wanted to have absolutely nothing to do with me, and I couldn't understand why.</seg>
<seg id="54">Why? What did I do? I didn't do anything to them!</seg>
<seg id="55">In my mind I was still a really cool kid.</seg>
<seg id="56">I had to go home and ask my parents, "What's wrong with me? What did I do? Why don't they like me?"</seg>
<seg id="57">They sat me down and said, "Lizzie, the only thing different about you is that you're smaller than the other kids. You have this syndrome, but it's not going to define who you are."</seg>
<seg id="58">They said, "Go to school, pick your head up, smile, continue to be yourself, and people will see that you're just like them."</seg>
<seg id="59">And so that's what I did.</seg>
<seg id="60">I want you to think, and ask yourself this in your head, right now: What defines you?</seg>
<seg id="61">Who are you?</seg>
<seg id="62">Is it where you come from? Is it your background? Is it your friends?</seg>
<seg id="63">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="64">What defines who you are as a person?</seg>
<seg id="65">It's taken me a very long time to figure out what defines me.</seg>
<seg id="66">For so long I thought what defined me was my outer appearance. I thought that my little tiny legs, and my little arms, and my little face were ugly.</seg>
<seg id="67">I thought I was disgusting.</seg>
<seg id="68">I hated when I'd wake up in the morning when I was going to middle school, and would be looking in the mirror getting ready, and thinking, "Can I just scrub this syndrome off? It would make my life so much easier if I could just scrub it off. I could look like other kids; I wouldn't have to buy clothes that had Dora the Explorer on them. I wouldn't have to buy stuff that was 'Bedazzled', when I was trying to be like the cool kids."</seg>
<seg id="69">I would wish, and pray, and hope, and do whatever I could so I would wake up in the morning and be different, and I wouldn't have to deal with these struggles.</seg>
<seg id="70">It's what I wanted every single day, and every single day I was disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="71">I have an amazing support system around me, who never pity me, who are there to pick me up if I'm sad, who are there to laugh with me during the good times, and they taught me that, even though I have this syndrome, even though things are hard, I can't let that define me.</seg>
<seg id="72">My life was put into my hands, just like your lives are put into yours.</seg>
<seg id="73">You are the person in the front seat of your car.</seg>
<seg id="74">You are the one who decides whether your car goes down a bad path, or a good path.</seg>
<seg id="75">You are the one who decides what defines you.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now let me tell you: it could be really hard to figure out what defines you, because there were times when I'd get so annoyed and frustrated, and say: "I don't care what defines me!"</seg>
<seg id="77">When I was in high school I found a video, unfortunately, that somebody posted of me, labeling me the world's ugliest woman.</seg>
<seg id="78">There were over four million views to this video; eight seconds long, no sound, thousands of comments; people saying, "Lizzie, please - please - just do the world a favor, put a gun to your head, and kill yourself."</seg>
<seg id="79">Think about that, if people told you that, if strangers told you this.</seg>
<seg id="80">I cried my eyes out of course, and I was ready to fight back and something kind of clicked in my head, and I thought, "I'm just going to leave it alone."</seg>
<seg id="81">I started realizing that my life is in my hands.</seg>
<seg id="82">I could either choose to make this really good, or I could choose to make this really bad.</seg>
<seg id="83">I could be grateful, and open my eyes and realize the things that I do have, and make those the things that define me.</seg>
<seg id="84">I can't see out of one eye, but I can see out of the other.</seg>
<seg id="85">I might get sick a lot, but I have really nice hair.</seg>
<seg id="86">You do, you do!</seg>
<seg id="87">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="88">You guys are like the best little section right here.</seg>
<seg id="89">(Lizzie laughs) You made me lose my train of thought!</seg>
<seg id="90">Okay... where was I?</seg>
<seg id="91">Audience: Your hair!</seg>
<seg id="92">Hair! Hair. Ok, ok, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</seg>
<seg id="93">So I could either choose to be happy or I could choose to be upset with what I have and still kind of complain about it, but then I started realizing: Am I going to let the people who called me a monster define me?</seg>
<seg id="94">Am I going to let the people who said, "Kill it with fire!" define me?</seg>
<seg id="95">No; I'm going to let my goals, and my success, and my accomplishments be the things that define me - Not my outer appearance, not the fact that I'm visually impaired, not the fact that I have this syndrome that nobody knows what it is.</seg>
<seg id="96">So I told myself I'm going to work my butt off and do whatever I could to make myself better, because in my mind, the best way that I could get back at all those people who made fun of me, who teased me, who called me ugly, who called me a monster was to make myself better, and to show them: You know what?</seg>
<seg id="97">Tell me those negative things, I'm going to turn them around, and I'm going to use them as a ladder to climb up to my goals.</seg>
<seg id="98">That's what I did.</seg>
<seg id="99">I told myself that I wanted to be a motivational speaker, I wanted to write a book, graduate college, have my own family, and have my own career.</seg>
<seg id="100">Eight years later, I’m standing in front of you, still doing motivational speaking.</seg>
<seg id="101">First thing, I accomplished it.</seg>
<seg id="102">I wanted to write a book; in a couple of weeks I will be submitting the manuscript for my third book.</seg>
<seg id="103">I wanted to graduate college, and I just finished college.</seg>
<seg id="104">(Cheers and applause)</seg>
<seg id="105">I'm getting a degree in Communication Studies from Texas State University in San Marcos, and I have a minor in English.</seg>
<seg id="106">I really, really tried to use real-life experience while I was getting my degree, and my professors were not having it.</seg>
<seg id="107">I wanted to have, lastly, my own family and my own career.</seg>
<seg id="108">The family part is kind of down the line, and my career part, I feel like I'm really doing well with it, considering the fact that when I decided I wanted to be a motivational speaker, I went home, I sat in front of my laptop, went to Google, and typed in: "How to be a motivational speaker."</seg>
<seg id="109">I'm not even joking.</seg>
<seg id="110">I worked my butt off. I used the people who were telling me that I couldn't do this to motivate me.</seg>
<seg id="111">I used their negativity to light my fire to keep going.</seg>
<seg id="112">Use that. Use that. Use that negativity that you have in your life to make yourself better, because I guarantee you - guarantee you - You will win.</seg>
<seg id="113">Now I want to end, with asking you again.</seg>
<seg id="114">I want you to leave here, and ask yourself what defines you.</seg>
<seg id="115">But remember: Brave starts here.</seg>
<seg id="116">Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="1">If you live on the east coast of the United States, you've spent the last 17 years of your life walking, eating and sleeping above a dormant army of insects.</seg>
<seg id="2">These are the cicadas.</seg>
<seg id="3">Every 17 years, billions of them emerge from the ground to do three things: molt, mate and die.</seg>
<seg id="4">There are 15 different broods of cicadas out there, grouped by when they'll emerge from the ground.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some of these broods are on a 13-year cycle, others are on a 17-year clock.</seg>
<seg id="6">Either way, the cicadas live underground for most of their lives, feeding on the juices of plant roots.</seg>
<seg id="7">When it's time to emerge, the adults begin to burrow their way out of the ground and up to the surface, where they'll live for just a few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="8">During these weeks, though, everybody will know the cicadas have arrived.</seg>
<seg id="9">There will be billions of them.</seg>
<seg id="10">Male cicadas band together to call for female mates, and their collective chorus can reach up to 100 decibels -- as loud as a chain saw.</seg>
<seg id="11">In fact, if you happen to be using a chain saw or a lawn mower, male cicadas will flock to you, thinking that you're one of them.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now, like most things in nature, the cicadas don't arrive without a posse.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are all sort of awesome and gross predators and parasites that come along with the buzzing bugs.</seg>
<seg id="14">Take the fungus Massospora for example.</seg>
<seg id="15">This little white fungus buries itself in the cicada's abdomen and eats the bug alive, leaving behind its spores.</seg>
<seg id="16">When those spores rupture, they burst out of the still-alive cicada, turning the bug into a flying saltshaker of death, raining spores down upon its unsuspecting cicada neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="17">But while we know pretty precisely when the cicadas will arrive and fade away, we're still not totally certain of why.</seg>
<seg id="18">There are certain advantages to having your entire species emerge at once, of course.</seg>
<seg id="19">The sheer number of cicadas coming out of the ground is so overwhelming to predators, it is essentially guaranteed that a few bugs will survive and reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="20">And since cicadas emerge every 13 or 17 years, longer than the lifespan of many of their predators, the animals that eat them don't learn to depend on their availability.</seg>
<seg id="21">But why 13 and 17 years, instead of 16 or 18 or 12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Well, that part no one really knows.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's possible the number just happened by chance, or, perhaps, cicadas really love prime numbers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Eventually, the cicadas will mate and slowly die off, their call fading into the distance.</seg>
<seg id="25">The eggs they lay will begin the cycle again, their cicada babies burrowing into the earth, feeding on plant juice, and waiting for their turn to darken the skies and fill the air with their songs.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 17 years, they'll be ready.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thousands of years in the making, what began as part of a religious festival honoring the Greek god Zeus in the rural Greek town of Olympia has today become the greatest show of sporting excellence on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="2">The inception date in 776 BC became the basis for the Greek's earliest calendar, where time was marked in four-year increments called olympiads.</seg>
<seg id="3">What could it be?</seg>
<seg id="4">Why, it's the Olympic games, of course.</seg>
<seg id="5">Competition fosters excellence, or so thought the Ancient Greeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to sporting events, contests were held for music, singing, and poetry.</seg>
<seg id="7">You can read about them all yourself in classical literary works, like Homer's "Iliad" and Virgil's "Aeneid."</seg>
<seg id="8">Even mythical heroes appreciate a good contest every now and then, wouldn't you say?</seg>
<seg id="9">For the first thirteen games, the Ancient Greek Olympics featured just one event, the two hundred yard dash.</seg>
<seg id="10">But over time, new exciting contests, like boxing, chariot and mule racing, and even a footrace where the competitors wore a full suit of armor enticed many hopeful champions into the Olympic stadium.</seg>
<seg id="11">The combined running, jumping, wrestling, javelin throwing, and hurling the discus events known as the pentathlon inspired world-class competition, and the pankration, a no holds barred fight where only biting and eye-gouging were prohibited, ensured the toughest men were victorious.</seg>
<seg id="12">And victorious they were.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nobody tops the local baker Coroebus, who 776 BC became the very first Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="14">And we'll never forget Orsippus of Megara, the 720 BC Olympic victor tore away his loincloth so he could race unimpeded, inaugurating the Ancient Greek tradition of competing in the nude.</seg>
<seg id="15">Now there's a winning streak, if ever we've seen one.</seg>
<seg id="16">But all good things must end.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 391 AD, the Christian Roman Emperor Theodosius banned pagan practices, so the world soon bid a fond farewell to the Olympic games.</seg>
<seg id="18">But just like those early pankration athletes, you can't keep a good one down, and 1500 years later in 1896, the modern Olympic games kicked off in Athens, Greece.</seg>
<seg id="19">Today, the Summer and Winter Olympics bring international world-class athletes together by the thousands, uniting fans by the billions for the world's foremost sporting competition.</seg>
<seg id="20">Citius, Altius, Fortius.</seg>
<seg id="21">Three cheers for the Olympics.</seg>

<seg id="1">Many generations have felt they’ve reached the pinnacle of technological advancement.</seg>
<seg id="2">Yet look back 100 years and the technologies we take for granted today would seem like impossible magic.</seg>
<seg id="3">So will there be a point where we reach an actual limit of technological progress?</seg>
<seg id="4">And if so, are we anywhere near that limit now?</seg>
<seg id="5">Half a century ago, Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev was asking similar questions when he came up with a way to measure technological progress; even when we have no idea exactly what it might look like.</seg>
<seg id="6">Anything we do in the future will require energy.</seg>
<seg id="7">So Kardashev’s scale classifies potential civilizations, whether alien civilizations out there in the universe or our own, into three levels based on energy consumption.</seg>
<seg id="8">The tiny amount of energy we currently consume pales next to what we leave untapped.</seg>
<seg id="9">A type I, or planetary civilization, can access all the energy resources of its home planet.</seg>
<seg id="10">In our case, this is the 174,000 terawatts Earth receives from the sun.</seg>
<seg id="11">We currently only harness about 15 terawatts of it, mostly by burning solar energy stored in fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="12">To approach becoming a type I civilization, we would need to capture solar energy more directly and efficiently by covering the planet with solar panels.</seg>
<seg id="13">Based on the most optimistic models, we might get there within just four centuries.</seg>
<seg id="14">What would be next?</seg>
<seg id="15">Well, the Earth only gets a sliver of the sun’s energy, while the rest of its 400 yottawatts is wasted in dead space.</seg>
<seg id="16">But a type II, or stellar civilization, would make the most of its home stars energy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead of installing solar panels around a planet, a type II civilization would install them directly orbiting its star, forming a theoretical structure called a Dyson sphere.</seg>
<seg id="18">And the third step, a type III civilization, would harness all the energy of its home galaxy.</seg>
<seg id="19">But we can also think of progress in the opposite way.</seg>
<seg id="20">How small can we go?</seg>
<seg id="21">To that end, British cosmologist John Barrow, classified civilizations by the size of objects they control.</seg>
<seg id="22">That ranges from mechanical structures at our own scale, to the building blocks of our own biology, down to unlocking atoms themselves.</seg>
<seg id="23">We’ve currently touched the atomic level, though our control remains limited.</seg>
<seg id="24">But we potentially could go much smaller in the future.</seg>
<seg id="25">To get a sense of the extent to which that’s true, the observable universe is 26 orders of magnitude larger than a human body.</seg>
<seg id="26">That means if you zoomed out by a factor of 10, 26 times, you’d be at the scale of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="27">But to reach the minimum length scale known as the Planck length, you would need to zoom in 35 times.</seg>
<seg id="28">As physicist Richard Feynman once said, there’s plenty of room at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="29">Instead of one or the other, it’s likely that our civilization will continue to develop along both Kardashev and Barrow scales.</seg>
<seg id="30">Precision on a smaller scale lets us use energy more efficiently and unlocks new energy sources like nuclear fusion or even antimatter.</seg>
<seg id="31">And this increased energy lets us expand and build on a larger scale.</seg>
<seg id="32">A truly advanced civilization then would harness both stellar energy and subatomic technologies.</seg>
<seg id="33">But these predictions weren't made just for us humans.</seg>
<seg id="34">They double as a possible means of detecting intelligent life in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="35">If we find a Dyson sphere around a distant star, that's a pretty compelling sign of life.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or what if instead of a structure that passively soaked up all of a star’s energy like a plant, an alien civilization built one that actively sucked the energy out of the star like a hummingbird?</seg>
<seg id="37">Frighteningly enough, we’ve observed super dense celestial bodies about the size of a planet that drain energy out of a much bigger star.</seg>
<seg id="38">It would be much too premature to conclude that this is evidence of life in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="39">There are also explanations for these observations that don’t involve alien life forms.</seg>
<seg id="40">But that doesn’t stop us from asking: what if?</seg>

<seg id="1">Have you ever sat in a doctor's office for hours despite having an appointment at a specific time?</seg>
<seg id="2">Has a hotel turned down your reservation because it's full?</seg>
<seg id="3">Or have you been bumped off a flight that you paid for?</seg>
<seg id="4">These are all symptoms of overbooking, a practice where businesses and institutions sell or book more than their full capacity.</seg>
<seg id="5">While often infuriating for the customer, overbooking happens because it increases profits while also letting businesses optimize their resources.</seg>
<seg id="6">They know that not everyone will show up to their appointments, reservations, and flights, so they make more available than they actually have to offer.</seg>
<seg id="7">Airlines are the classical example, partially because it happens so often.</seg>
<seg id="8">About 50,000 people get bumped off their flights each year.</seg>
<seg id="9">That figure comes at little surprise to the airlines themselves, which use statistics to determine exactly how many tickets to sell.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a delicate operation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sell too few, and they're wasting seats.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sell too many, and they pay penalties - money, free flights, hotel stays, and annoyed customers.</seg>
<seg id="13">So here's a simplified version of how their calculations work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Airlines have collected years worth of information about who does and doesn't show up for certain flights.</seg>
<seg id="15">They know, for example, that on a particular route, the probability that each individual customer will show up on time is 90%.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the sake of simplicity, we'll assume that every customer is traveling individually rather than as families or groups.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then, if there are 180 seats on the plane and they sell 180 tickets, the most likely result is that 162 passengers will board.</seg>
<seg id="18">But, of course, you could also end up with more passengers, or fewer.</seg>
<seg id="19">The probability for each value is given by what's called a binomial distribution, which peaks at the most likely outcome.</seg>
<seg id="20">Now let's look at the revenue.</seg>
<seg id="21">The airline makes money from each ticket buyer and loses money for each person who gets bumped.</seg>
<seg id="22">Let's say a ticket costs $250 and isn't exchangeable for a later flight.</seg>
<seg id="23">And the cost of bumping a passenger is $800.</seg>
<seg id="24">These numbers are just for the sake of example.</seg>
<seg id="25">Actual amounts vary considerably.</seg>
<seg id="26">So here, if you don't sell any extra tickets, you make $45,000.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you sell 15 extras and at least 15 people are no shows, you make $48,750.</seg>
<seg id="28">That's the best case.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the worst case, everyone shows up.</seg>
<seg id="30">15 unlucky passengers get bumped, and the revenue will only be $36,750, even less than if you only sold 180 tickets in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="31">But what matters isn't just how good or bad a scenario is financially, but how likely it is to happen.</seg>
<seg id="32">So how likely is each scenario?</seg>
<seg id="33">We can find out by using the binomial distribution.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this example, the probability of exactly 195 passengers boarding is almost 0%.</seg>
<seg id="35">The probability of exactly 184 passengers boarding is 1.11%, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="36">Multiply these probabilities by the revenue for each case, add them all up, and subtract the sum from the earnings by 195 sold tickets, and you get the expected revenue for selling 195 tickets.</seg>
<seg id="37">By repeating this calculation for various numbers of extra tickets, the airline can find the one likely to yield the highest revenue.</seg>
<seg id="38">In this example, that's 198 tickets, from which the airline will probably make $48,774, almost 4,000 more than without overbooking.</seg>
<seg id="39">And that's just for one flight.</seg>
<seg id="40">Multiply that by a million flights per airline per year, and overbooking adds up fast.</seg>
<seg id="41">Of course, the actual calculation is much more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="42">Airlines apply many factors to create even more accurate models.</seg>
<seg id="43">But should they?</seg>
<seg id="44">Some argue that overbooking is unethical.</seg>
<seg id="45">You're charging two people for the same resource.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course, if you're 100% sure someone won't show up, it's fine to sell their seat.</seg>
<seg id="47">But what if you're only 95% sure?</seg>
<seg id="48">75%?</seg>
<seg id="49">Is there a number that separates being unethical from being practical?</seg>

<seg id="1">The sight of mistletoe may either send you scurrying or if you have your eye on someone, awaiting an opportunity beneath its snow white berries.</seg>
<seg id="2">But how did the festive Christmas tradition of kissing under mistletoe come about?</seg>
<seg id="3">The long lived custom intertwines the mythology and biology of this intriguing plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">There are more than 1,000 species of mistletoe which grows the world over.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, the ancient Europeans were so captivated by the plant’s unusual growth habits that they included it in their legends and myths.</seg>
<seg id="6">In ancient Rome, Pliny the Elder described how the Druid priesthood in ancient England believed that mistletoe was a plant dropped down from heaven by the gods; that explained its unlikely position amongst the high branches of certain trees.</seg>
<seg id="7">They also believed it had powers of healing and bestowing fertility.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, Scandinavian legends told of the plant’s mystical qualities in the story of the god Baldur and his adoring mother, Frigg, goddess of love, marriage and fertility.</seg>
<seg id="9">Frigg loved her son so much that she commanded every plant, animal and inanimate object to vow they’d never harm him.</seg>
<seg id="10">In her fervor, however, she overlooked the mistletoe.</seg>
<seg id="11">The mischievous god Loki realized this oversight, and pierced Baldur’s heart with an arrow carved from a mistletoe branch.</seg>
<seg id="12">Frigg cried tears of such sadness that they formed the mistletoe’s pearly berries, making the other gods pity her and agree to resurrect Baldur.</seg>
<seg id="13">Hearing the news, Frigg became so overjoyed that she transformed the mistletoe from a symbol of death into one of peace and love.</seg>
<seg id="14">She mandated a one day truce for all fights and that everyone embraced beneath its branches when they passed to spread more love into the world.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the 17th century, British colonists arriving in the New World found a different but very similar looking species of mistletoe.</seg>
<seg id="16">They applied it to these tales of magic, fertility and love, spreading the mistletoe hanging tradition from Europe into America.</seg>
<seg id="17">By the 18th century, people in Britain had turned this into a Christmas tradition.</seg>
<seg id="18">But this custom comes down to more than just human imagination.</seg>
<seg id="19">All of it was inspired by the plant’s intriguing biology.</seg>
<seg id="20">We see mistletoe as a festive decoration, but draped on tree boughs in the wild, it’s known as a partly parasitic plant.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mistletoe relies on modified roots called haustoria that penetrate the tree bark and siphon off the water and minerals trees carry up their trunks.</seg>
<seg id="22">To colonize nearby trees with its seeds, mistletoe depends on birds and other creatures to do the dispersing.</seg>
<seg id="23">Birds that eat the mistletoe’s sticky white berries sometimes get rid of the gluey seeds by wiping them off onto tree bark, or with a bit of luck, they excrete the indigestible seed onto a tree where it germinates and starts to grow.</seg>
<seg id="24">With its resilience and foliage that stays lush even while the surrounding trees lose their leaves, you can see why mistletoe captivated our superstitious ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="25">They saw these as signs of the plant’s magical qualities and fertility.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even today, the mistletoe inspires wonder with the diversity of wildlife it supports.</seg>
<seg id="27">More than just a parasite, it’s also known as a keystone species.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's eaten by a diversity of animals, including deer, elk, squirrels, chipmunks, porcupines, robins, bluebirds, mourning doves, and the butterfly genus Delius.</seg>
<seg id="29">Some mistletoe species produce dense bushes, which are excellent nesting locations for a variety of birds.</seg>
<seg id="30">And despite their parasitic relationship with trees, mistletoes can also help other plants.</seg>
<seg id="31">For instance, juniper sprouts near mistletoe to benefit from the visiting berry-eating birds.</seg>
<seg id="32">Through the many benefits it provides, mistletoe influences diversity and allows ecosystems to flourish.</seg>
<seg id="33">You might even say, that for this iconic plant, life imitates legend.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the wild, mistletoe has the power to bring things together.</seg>
<seg id="35">And in our own traditions we see that happening too.</seg>

<seg id="1">After witnessing the violent rage shown by babies whenever deprived of an item they considered their own, Jean Piaget, a founding father of child psychology, observed something profound about human nature.</seg>
<seg id="2">Our sense of ownership emerges incredibly early.</seg>
<seg id="3">Why are we so clingy?</seg>
<seg id="4">There's a well-established phenomenon in psychology known as the endowment effect where we value items much more highly just as soon as we own them.</seg>
<seg id="5">In one famous demonstration, students were given a choice between a coffee mug or a Swiss chocolate bar as a reward for helping out with research.</seg>
<seg id="6">Half chose the mug, and half chose the chocolate.</seg>
<seg id="7">That is, they seemed to value the two rewards similarly.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other students were given a mug first and then a surprise chance to swap it for a chocolate bar, but only 11% wanted to.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yet another group started out with chocolate, and most preferred to keep it rather than swap.</seg>
<seg id="10">In other words, the students nearly always put greater value on whichever reward they started out with.</seg>
<seg id="11">Part of this has to do with how quickly we form connections between our sense of self and the things we consider ours.</seg>
<seg id="12">That can even be seen at the neural level.</seg>
<seg id="13">In one experiment, neuroscientists scanned participants' brains while they allocated various objects either to a basket labeled "mine," or another labeled, "Alex's."</seg>
<seg id="14">When participants subsequently looked at their new things, their brains showed more activity in a region that usually flickers into life whenever we think about ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="15">Another reason we're so fond of our possessions is that from a young age we believe they have a unique essence.</seg>
<seg id="16">Psychologists showed us this by using an illusion to convince three to six-year-olds they built a copying machine, a device that could create perfect replicas of any item.</seg>
<seg id="17">When offered a choice between their favorite toy or an apparently exact copy, the majority of the children favored the original.</seg>
<seg id="18">In fact, they were often horrified at the prospect of taking home a copy.</seg>
<seg id="19">This magical thinking about objects isn't something we grow out of.</seg>
<seg id="20">Rather it persists into adulthood while becoming ever more elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, consider the huge value placed on items that have been owned by celebrities.</seg>
<seg id="22">It's as if the buyers believed the objects they'd purchased were somehow imbued with the essence of their former celebrity owners.</seg>
<seg id="23">For similar reasons, many of us are reluctant to part with family heirlooms which help us feel connected to lost loved ones.</seg>
<seg id="24">These beliefs can even alter our perception of the physical world and change our athletic abilities.</seg>
<seg id="25">Participants in a recent study were told they were using a golf putter once owned by the champion Ben Curtis.</seg>
<seg id="26">During the experiment, they perceived the hole as being about a centimeter larger than controlled participants using a standard putter and they sank slightly more putts.</seg>
<seg id="27">Although feelings of ownership emerge early in life, culture also plays a part.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, it was recently discovered that Hadza people of northern Tanzania who are isolated from modern culture don't exhibit the endowment effect.</seg>
<seg id="29">That's possibly because they live in an egalitarian society where almost everything is shared.</seg>
<seg id="30">At the other extreme, sometimes our attachment to our things can go too far.</seg>
<seg id="31">Part of the cause of hoarding disorder is an exaggerated sense of responsibility and protectiveness toward one's belongings.</seg>
<seg id="32">That's why people with this condition find it so difficult to throw anything away.</seg>
<seg id="33">What remains to be seen today is how the nature of our relationship with our possessions will change with the rise of digital technologies.</seg>
<seg id="34">Many have forecast the demise of physical books and music, but for now, at least, this seems premature.</seg>
<seg id="35">Perhaps there will always be something uniquely satisfying about holding an object in our hands and calling it our own.</seg>

<seg id="1">Transcriber: Liam Regan Reviewer: Denise RQ Hi! Hi!</seg>
<seg id="2">I am forty-five years old.</seg>
<seg id="3">I know I look amazing, thank you. I am forty-five years old and I have never once unselfconsciously held hands with a lover in public.</seg>
<seg id="4">I am forty-five years old and I have never once casually, comfortably, carelessly held hands with a partner in public.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't know how many of you can even imagine what that might be like because, of course, it's a small thing, isn't it, holding hands with a lover in public?</seg>
<seg id="6">And it's not that nobody wanted to, it's just that we didn't feel comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now, like many gay people, when I was younger, in my young life, I struggled at one time against being gay.</seg>
<seg id="8">I didn't want to be different.</seg>
<seg id="9">I didn't want to be this thing that I didn't really understand.</seg>
<seg id="10">This thing that I had learned was shameful or jokeworthy.</seg>
<seg id="11">But when I eventually did sort of understand and come to accept who and what I am, I have never since that moment, never once, have I ever wished that it turned out differently!</seg>
<seg id="12">I am thoroughly, deeply, delightedly, happy to be gay!</seg>
<seg id="13">It suits me! I am really good at it! And yet, everyday I am jealous of straight people, because that private, little, small, intimate gesture of affection has never once been mine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Everyday I see young, straight couples walking through the park and they are casually holding hands and I am jealous of them!</seg>
<seg id="15">I see a teenage couple at a bus stop and she is leaning into him, and her hand is in his, and both of their hands are tucked into his jacket pocket for warmth, and I am jealous of that teenage couple!</seg>
<seg id="16">I will sometimes see a man who unconsciously put his hand, a protective arm, around his girlfriend and she'll link her fingers through his, and I am jealous of that!</seg>
<seg id="17">Maybe you're on Grafton Street and you see an older lady and she gestures to draw her husband's attention to something in the window, and without even thinking he just takes her hand and they stand there peering into the window discussing whatever it is that drew their attention and their hands are just carelessly joined together, and I am jealous of that!</seg>
<seg id="18">Because gay people do not get to hold hands in public without first considering the risk.</seg>
<seg id="19">Gay people do not get to put an arm through another arm or put a hand on a boyfriend's waist without first considering what the possible consequences might be.</seg>
<seg id="20">We look around to see: where are we, who's around, is it late at night? What kind of area is it?</seg>
<seg id="21">Are there bored teenagers hanging around looking for amusement?</seg>
<seg id="22">Are there bunches of lads standing outside a pub?</seg>
<seg id="23">And if we decided OK, maybe it is, it's OK, well then we do hold hands, but the thing is that now those hands are not casual and thoughtless.</seg>
<seg id="24">They are now considered and weighed.</seg>
<seg id="25">But we stroll on hand in hand trying to be just normal and carefree just like everybody else, but actually we're not!</seg>
<seg id="26">Because we are constantly scanning the pavement ahead, just in case.</seg>
<seg id="27">And then even if we do see, you know, a group of blokes coming towards us, maybe we will decide sort of silently to continue holding hands, defiantly!</seg>
<seg id="28">But now our small, intimate gesture between two people in love is no longer a small, intimate gesture.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is a political act of defiance, and it has been ruined.</seg>
<seg id="30">And anyway then you sort of think: "Well, we've had such a lovely afternoon poking around in that garden center looking at things for the garden we don't actually have."</seg>
<seg id="31">And then you think, all it will take is one spat "faggots" or a split lip to turn that really lovely afternoon into a bad afternoon that you will never want to remember.</seg>
<seg id="32">And even if you are somewhere where you think: "Ah, it's perfectly fine here. Nobody here is going to react badly to our tiny gesture."</seg>
<seg id="33">You know, I don't know, say you're wandering through a posh department store.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even then people will notice.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now, they may only notice because they're thinking: "Isn't nice to see two gays holding hands in public?"</seg>
<seg id="36">But they still notice, and I don't want them to notice because then our small, intimate, private, little, human gesture has been turned into a statement, and I don't want that!</seg>
<seg id="37">Our little, private, gesture, like Schrödinger's cat, is altered simply by being observed.</seg>
<seg id="38">We live in this sort of homophobic world, and you might think that a small, little thing like holding hands in public, "Well, it's just a small thing," and you're right!</seg>
<seg id="39">It is indeed just a small thing.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it is one of many small things that make us human, and there are lots of small things everyday that LGBT people have to put up with, that other people don't have to put up with.</seg>
<seg id="41">Lots of small things that we have to put up with in order to be safe or not to be the object of ridicule or scorn.</seg>
<seg id="42">And we are expected to put up with those things and just thank our blessings that we don't live in a country where we could be imprisoned or executed for being gay.</seg>
<seg id="43">And we are so used to making those small adjustments everyday, that even now we rarely ourselves even notice that we are doing it, because it is just part of the background of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="44">This constant malign presence that we have assimilated, and if we complain about it, we are told we have nothing to complain about because: "Aren't you lucky that you don't live in Uganda?"</seg>
<seg id="45">And yes, I am lucky that I don't live in Uganda, but that's not good enough!</seg>
<seg id="46">This isn't some sort of game or competition where the person who has it the worst wins the right to complain and everybody else has to just put up or shut up.</seg>
<seg id="47">Our society is homophobic!</seg>
<seg id="48">It is infused with homophobia.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is dripping with homophobia.</seg>
<seg id="50">And when you are forty-five years old and you have spent thirty years putting up, thirty years absorbing all of those small slights and intimidations and sneers and occasionally much worse, you just get tired of it.</seg>
<seg id="51">You get fed up putting up.</seg>
<seg id="52">I am fed up of reading yet another article by yet another straight person explaining why I am less somehow than everybody else.</seg>
<seg id="53">You get fed up listening to people describe you as intrinsically disordered, people who don't even know you, from their celibate pulpits.</seg>
<seg id="54">You get fed up of the scrawled graffiti, and you get fed up of people sneeringly describe things as gay.</seg>
<seg id="55">You get fed up of steeling yourself to pass by the Saturday night drunks hoping that they won't notice you, and you get fed up of people using their time and energies and talents to campaign against you being treated just like every other citizen.</seg>
<seg id="56">I'm forty-five and I'm fed up putting up.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now I would, of course, prefer if nobody harbored any animosity towards gay people or any discomfort with gay relationships, but, you know, I can live with the kind of small, personal, private homophobia that some people might have.</seg>
<seg id="58">For example, I can live with Mary in Wicklow who sometimes turns on the television and sees Graham Norton and thinks, "Oh, he seems nice enough but does he have to be so gay?"</seg>
<seg id="59">I can live with that.</seg>
<seg id="60">I can live with Mary who doesn't know any gay people, apart from that fella who does her hair once a month in "Curl Up and Dye".</seg>
<seg id="61">Mary, whose only knowledge of gay people and our relationships comes from what she has gleaned from schoolyards, church and Coronation Street.</seg>
<seg id="62">I can live with that.</seg>
<seg id="63">I would be happy to sit down on the sofa and watch Coronation Street with Mary.</seg>
<seg id="64">I would be happy to have a cup of tea with her and discuss with her why she feels a little uncomfortable with gay relationships and I would hope that Mary would change her mind.</seg>
<seg id="65">I would hope that she would meet more gay people and find out pretty quickly that we are just as ordinary, just as nice or just as annoying as all of you people are.</seg>
<seg id="66">And I would hope that she would change her mind for her own sake as much as anybody else's, because gay people are just as capable of bringing goodness into Mary's life as anybody else.</seg>
<seg id="67">And, of course, we could help her with the decorating!</seg>
<seg id="68">But that kind of personal discomfort with gay people and their relationships is entirely different from the kind of homophobia that manifests itself in public.</seg>
<seg id="69">The kind of homophobia that manifests itself in an attempt to have LGBT people treated differently or less than everybody else.</seg>
<seg id="70">The kind of homophobia that seeks to characterize gay people and their relationships as less worthy of respect.</seg>
<seg id="71">That kind of homophobia I do have a problem with, and I think gay people should be allowed to call it when they see it, because it is our right to do so!</seg>
<seg id="72">Of course, many people object to the word homophobia itself.</seg>
<seg id="73">They object to the "phobia" part.</seg>
<seg id="74">'I'm not afraid of you," they say.</seg>
<seg id="75">But I'm not saying that homophobes cower in fear every time they pass a Cher album,</seg>
<seg id="76">but they are afraid.</seg>
<seg id="77">They are afraid of what the world will look like when it treats gay, lesbian and bisexual people with the same respect as everybody else.</seg>
<seg id="78">They are afraid that they won't fit in this brave new world of equality.</seg>
<seg id="79">But, of course, their fear is irrational because, of course, the world will not look any different.</seg>
<seg id="80">Kids will still want to eat ice cream, dogs will still play fetch, the tide will still come in, and parallel parking will still be difficult.</seg>
<seg id="81">The most vocal homophobes who know that they long ago lost the arguments around the decriminalization of homosexual sex or every other advance for gay people since.</seg>
<seg id="82">These days you will find those very vocal homophobes clustered around the same-sex marriage debate -- and it is quite the spectacle because, of course, they know that they can't just come right out and bluntly say what drives them, which is an animus towards gay people, and a disgust at what they imagine we do in bed, because they know that that won't wash with the general public anymore.</seg>
<seg id="83">So they are forced to sort of scramble for any other reason that they can think of to argue their case.</seg>
<seg id="84">So, gay people are going to destroy the institution of marriage, gay couples will be wandering through orphanages picking babies off shelves trying to find one that matches their new IKEA sofa.</seg>
<seg id="85">Or that allowing gay people to get married will destroy society itself, and many, many more including my own personal favorite, which is the old argument that the word "marriage" is defined in some dictionary as a union between a man and a woman, and that therefore same-sex marriage can't possibly be a "marriage".</seg>
<seg id="86">Which is a piffling argument against words and dictionaries and not an argument against same-sex marriage.</seg>
<seg id="87">Now, of course, the other real driver of homophobia, and you can all clutch your pearls here because I am going to go here, is a disgust with gay sex, in particular with gay male sex.</seg>
<seg id="88">The poor old lesbians just get caught in the homophobic crossfire. You know guilty by association.</seg>
<seg id="89">Because what they really don't like is anal sex, sodomy, you know, buggery, and they assume that that is all we do.</seg>
<seg id="90">They feverishly imagine that we spend all day jumping around buggering each other.</seg>
<seg id="91">I mean they obsess on it, and, in fact, what they actually do, is reduce us down to this one sex act, whether or not we do it at all, because we are not regular people with the same hopes and aspirations and ambitions and feelings as everyone else, we are simply walking sex acts.</seg>
<seg id="92">Earlier this year I was invited to take part in the St. Pat's for All parade in Queens, New York.</seg>
<seg id="93">Now it is a really lovely, charming, grassroots event in Queens which was set up in response to the ban on gay groups marching in the famous Manhattan St. Patrick's Day Parade.</seg>
<seg id="94">In that Manhattan St. Patrick's Day Parade any Irish group who wants can march, Irish policemen can march, Irish firemen, Irish footballers, Irish community groups, Irish volleyball teams, Irish book clubs.</seg>
<seg id="95">Any Irish people who want to have a good shot at being allowed to march in that parade -- except for Irish gays, because, as far as the organizers of that parade are concerned, gays are nothing more than walking sex acts, and there is no place for buggery in their parade.</seg>
<seg id="96">Now, I actually saw a small documentary once about one of the leaders of the organizers of that parade, they are the Ancient Order of Hibernians, and they're like a Catholic Orange Order</seg>
<seg id="97">-- they dress the same and everything --</seg>
<seg id="98">and in the documentary, you know, he was a nice old fellow, and he had this lovely wife, and they seemed very happy together.</seg>
<seg id="99">And when I looked at them, I saw this life lived together, and I imagined if I asked him about their life together, that he would remember the first time they met, he would remember how nervous he was on their first date together, and how proud he was when he turned and saw her coming up the aisle in that dress that she had fretted over for so long.</seg>
<seg id="100">And I imagine that if I asked him, he would remember that phone call to say that she had gone into labor and the dash across town, and the other time when she went so far past her due date that she promised she would bounce up and down on a trampoline until the baby bounced out of her and how they laughed so hard about that.</seg>
<seg id="101">And I imagine he would remember other occasions like when their youngest broke his arm and cried all the way to the hospital, and that other time when she was sick and he could not sleep alone in the empty bed and so in the middle of the night he got up and went back to the hospital even though he knew they wouldn't let him in to see her at that hour.</seg>
<seg id="102">I imagine that he would remember all of those things and many more.</seg>
<seg id="103">All of the small things that go up to making a relationship and making a person a person.</seg>
<seg id="104">And when I looked at him, I imagined all of those things too.</seg>
<seg id="105">But when he looks at me he doesn't see me that way.</seg>
<seg id="106">He doesn't see gay people that way.</seg>
<seg id="107">To him we are just sex acts and there is no place for sex acts in his parade.</seg>
<seg id="108">I am forty-five years old and I am fed up putting up.</seg>
<seg id="109">So, I'm not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="110">I'm forty-five years old and I am not putting up anymore because I don't have the energy anymore.</seg>
<seg id="111">Putting up is exhausting!</seg>
<seg id="112">I am forty-five years old and I'm not putting up anymore because I don't have the patience anymore.</seg>
<seg id="113">Forty-five years old! I was born six months before the Stonewall riots, and you have had forty-five years to work out, that despite appearances, I am just as ordinary, just as unremarkable, and just as human as you are!</seg>
<seg id="114">I'm forty-five years old and I am not asking anymore I am just being -- human being!</seg>
<seg id="115">Thank you for your time!</seg>

<seg id="1">On the dusty roads of a small village, a travelling salesman was having difficulty selling his wares.</seg>
<seg id="2">He’d recently traversed the region just a few weeks ago, and most of the villagers had already seen his supply.</seg>
<seg id="3">So he wandered the outskirts of the town in the hopes of finding some new customers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Unfortunately, the road was largely deserted, and the salesman was about to turn back, when he heard a high-pitched yelp coming from the edge of the forest.</seg>
<seg id="5">Following the screams to their source, he discovered a trapped tanuki.</seg>
<seg id="6">While these racoon-like creatures were known for their wily ways, this one appeared terrified and powerless.</seg>
<seg id="7">The salesman freed the struggling creature, but before he could tend to its wounds, it bolted into the undergrowth.</seg>
<seg id="8">The next day, he set off on his usual route.</seg>
<seg id="9">As he trudged along, he spotted a discarded tea kettle.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was rusty and old— but perhaps he could sell it to the local monks.</seg>
<seg id="11">The salesman polished it until it sparkled and shone.</seg>
<seg id="12">He carried the kettle to Morin-ji Temple and presented it to the solemn monks.</seg>
<seg id="13">His timing was perfect— they were in need of a large kettle for an important service, and purchased his pot for a handsome price.</seg>
<seg id="14">To open the ceremony, they began to pour cups of tea for each monk— but the kettle cooled too quickly.</seg>
<seg id="15">It had to be reheated often throughout the long service, and when it was hot, it seemed to squirm in the pourer’s hand.</seg>
<seg id="16">By the end of the ceremony, the monks felt cheated by their purchase, and called for the salesman to return and explain himself.</seg>
<seg id="17">The following morning, the salesman examined the pot, but he couldn’t find anything unusual about it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hoping a cup of tea would help them think, they set the kettle on the fire.</seg>
<seg id="19">Within moments, the metal began to sweat.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly, it sprouted a scrubby tail, furry paws and pointed nose.</seg>
<seg id="21">With a yelp, the salesman recognized the tanuki he’d freed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The salesman was shocked.</seg>
<seg id="23">He’d heard tales of shape-shifting tanuki who transformed by pulling on their testicles.</seg>
<seg id="24">But they were usually troublesome tricksters, who played embarrassing pranks on travellers, or made it rain money that later dissolved into leaves.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some people even placed tanuki statues outside their homes and businesses to trick potential pranksters into taking their antics elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, this tanuki only smiled sweetly.</seg>
<seg id="27">Why had he chosen this unsuspecting form?</seg>
<seg id="28">The tanuki explained that he wanted to repay the salesman’s kindness.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, he’d grown too hot as a tea kettle, and didn’t like being burned, scrubbed, or polished.</seg>
<seg id="30">The monk and salesman laughed, both impressed by this honourable trickster.</seg>
<seg id="31">From that day on, the tanuki became an esteemed guest of the temple.</seg>
<seg id="32">He could frequently be found telling tales and performing tricks that amused even the most serious monks.</seg>
<seg id="33">Villagers came from far away to see the temple tanuki, and the salesman visited often to share tea made from an entirely normal kettle.</seg>

<seg id="1">In 1942, a mother-daughter duo Katherine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers developed a questionnaire that classified people’s personalities into 16 types.</seg>
<seg id="2">Called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, or MBTI, it would go on to become one of the world’s most widely-used personality tests.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today, personality testing is a multi-billion dollar industry used by individuals, schools, and companies.</seg>
<seg id="4">But none of these tests, including the MBTI, the Big Five, the DiSC assessment, the Process Communication Model, and the Enneagram, actually reveal truths about personality.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, it’s up for debate whether personality is a stable, measurable feature of an individual at all.</seg>
<seg id="6">Part of the problem is the way the tests are constructed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Each is based on a different set of metrics to define personality: the Myers-Briggs, for instance, focuses on features like introversion and extroversion to classify people into personality "types," while the Big Five scores participants on five different traits.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most are self-reported, meaning the results are based on questions participants answer about themselves.</seg>
<seg id="9">So it’s easy to lie, but even with the best intentions, objective self-evaluation is tricky.</seg>
<seg id="10">Take this question from the Big Five: How would you rate the accuracy of the statement "I am always prepared"?</seg>
<seg id="11">There’s a clear favorable answer here, which makes it difficult to be objective.</seg>
<seg id="12">People subconsciously aim to please: when asked to agree or disagree, we show a bias toward answering however we believe the person or institution asking the question wants us to answer.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here’s another question— what do you value more, justice or fairness?</seg>
<seg id="14">What about harmony or forgiveness?</seg>
<seg id="15">You may well value both sides of each pair, but the MBTI would force you to choose one.</seg>
<seg id="16">And while it’s tempting to assume the results of that forced choice must somehow reveal a true preference, they don’t: When faced with the same forced choice question multiple times, the same person will sometimes change their answer.</seg>
<seg id="17">Given these design flaws, it’s no surprise that test results can be inconsistent.</seg>
<seg id="18">One study found that nearly half of people who take the Myers-Briggs a second time only five weeks after the first get assigned a different type.</seg>
<seg id="19">And other studies on the Myers-Briggs have found that people with very similar scores end up being placed in different categories, suggesting that the strict divisions between personality types don’t reflect real-life nuances.</seg>
<seg id="20">Complicating matters further, the definitions of personality traits are constantly shifting.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, who popularized the terms introvert and extrovert, defined an introvert as someone who sticks to their principles regardless of situation, and an extrovert as someone who molds their self according to circumstance.</seg>
<seg id="22">Introversion later came to mean shyness, while an extrovert was someone outgoing.</seg>
<seg id="23">Today, an introvert is someone who finds alone time restorative, an extrovert draws energy from social interaction, and an ambivert falls somewhere between these two extremes.</seg>
<seg id="24">The notion of an innate, unchanging personality forms the basis of all these tests.</seg>
<seg id="25">But research increasingly suggests that personality shifts during key periods— like our school years, or when we start working.</seg>
<seg id="26">Though certain features of a person’s behavior may remain relatively stable over time, others are malleable, moulded by our upbringing, life experiences, and age.</seg>
<seg id="27">All of this matters more or less depending on how a personality test is used.</seg>
<seg id="28">Though anyone using them should take the results with a grain of salt, there isn’t much harm in individual use— and users may even learn some new terms and concepts in the process.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the use of personality tests extends far beyond self discovery.</seg>
<seg id="30">Schools use them to advise students what to study and what jobs to pursue.</seg>
<seg id="31">Companies use them decide who to hire and for what positions.</seg>
<seg id="32">Yet the results don’t predict how a person will perform in a specific role.</seg>
<seg id="33">So by using personality tests this way, institutions can deprive people of opportunities they’d excel at, or discourage them from considering certain paths.</seg>

<seg id="1">Transcriber: TED Translators Admin Reviewer: Joanna Pietrulewicz My parents were refugees of communism.</seg>
<seg id="2">Growing up, I watched my mom and dad work two full-time jobs without ever complaining, so my siblings and I could live a better life than they did.</seg>
<seg id="3">I was proud to be their daughter.</seg>
<seg id="4">And I understood the immigrant part of my identity well.</seg>
<seg id="5">The female part of my identity, however, was much harder for me to own.</seg>
<seg id="6">I never wanted to draw attention to my gender, because I was afraid I wouldn’t be taken seriously as a CEO.</seg>
<seg id="7">So I focused my energy on the things that I thought were important, stuff like making my team laugh.</seg>
<seg id="8">I remember I would painstakingly write and rehearse jokes before every all-hands.</seg>
<seg id="9">Or I'd be the first one in the office and the last one out, because I thought that these things mattered.</seg>
<seg id="10">When I was six months pregnant, one of our large competitors reached out, wanting to talk about acquiring us.</seg>
<seg id="11">Every startup wants the option to be bought, but it really got under my skin when during conversations with these strangers who I was negotiating with, their eyes would sometimes wander to my pregnant belly.</seg>
<seg id="12">I went into labor the same night of our user conference.</seg>
<seg id="13">The weeks leading up to the event, watching our team prepare for our big product unveiling, I wondered how many male CEOs would skip their own conference for the birth of their child.</seg>
<seg id="14">I assumed most would.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I kept reasoning with myself that if I wasn't pregnant, there'd be no question whether I'd be there or not.</seg>
<seg id="16">So I have to be there, forcing myself to parade my nine-month pregnancy, work the halls as hosts on my feet for 14 hours was a bad idea in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="17">The moment I arrived home, my water broke and my contractions started and I wouldn't hear my son's first cry for another 32 hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">When my baby was six weeks old, I went back to work.</seg>
<seg id="19">Our M and A had fallen through by then, and I was determined to fundraise a war chest to fight them back.</seg>
<seg id="20">But I was still bleeding from several tears in my vagina from pushing out a baby.</seg>
<seg id="21">To this day, I still ask myself why I rushed back to work when I wasn't ready.</seg>
<seg id="22">And I realize now it was because I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was so afraid of what people might think of me as a new mother and CEO.</seg>
<seg id="24">I was afraid that they would think that my priorities had changed.</seg>
<seg id="25">So I pressured myself into proving to everyone that I was as dedicated to the company as ever.</seg>
<seg id="26">I would spend the next two months fundraising to secure our war chest.</seg>
<seg id="27">I had a full schedule and I needed to pump milk, but I didn't have the courage to ask for 50 million dollars and ask to use their mother's room.</seg>
<seg id="28">So how does one pump milk on Sand Hill Road?</seg>
<seg id="29">Well, I would park my car in front of someone's super nice home in Palo Alto.</seg>
<seg id="30">I'd undress and extract milk from my breasts with a silicone hand pump.</seg>
<seg id="31">It worked out, I guess.</seg>
<seg id="32">We secured a lead investor for our series C and then our competitors came back with a revised offer, and we decided to sell to them for 875 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="33">A few months after the acquisition I became pregnant for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="34">And shortly after, I found out I had a miscarriage.</seg>
<seg id="35">While with my team ...</seg>
<seg id="36">I felt it slip out of me.</seg>
<seg id="37">I went to the bathroom ...</seg>
<seg id="38">and it fell to the floor.</seg>
<seg id="39">I didn't know what to do, so I just walked back out to the team, pretending as if nothing happened.</seg>
<seg id="40">It took going through infertility, miscarriage, pregnancy, giving birth without any drugs, while running a company for me to realize how wrong I was to hide my womanhood as if it's something I'm ashamed of.</seg>
<seg id="41">For so long, I thought I had to be what I thought a good male CEO looked like so that I wouldn't be judged or treated differently.</seg>
<seg id="42">I was so constricted by my belief that businesses value maleness more.</seg>
<seg id="43">And it made me afraid to be a woman, which meant I hid a massive part of who I was from everyone.</seg>
<seg id="44">When I dared to be fully myself, when I dared to trust and share my frustrations and my anger and my sadness and my tears with my team, I became a much happier and more effective leader because I was finally honest in who I was.</seg>
<seg id="45">And my team responded to that.</seg>
<seg id="46">One of the most important side effects of leading as my complete raw self was seeing our culture evolve to a more close-knit and effective version of itself.</seg>
<seg id="47">I remember we had several back to back rough quarters.</seg>
<seg id="48">It felt like everything was in shambles and I didn't have time to prepare for an all-hands.</seg>
<seg id="49">And then it was time for me to speak.</seg>
<seg id="50">So I walked up to the mic cold and I started talking openly about my concerns, my concerns on competition, the mistakes we had made in sales strategy, really exposing the weaknesses of our company.</seg>
<seg id="51">And I asked the team for help.</seg>
<seg id="52">That completely changed the conversation and how we would build and solve problems together.</seg>
<seg id="53">As we collectively brought our full selves to work, we were able to accomplish so much more in terms of revenue growth and the most products shipped the company had seen.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it progressed us from a startup to medium-sized business.</seg>
<seg id="55">Whoever you are, if you're thinking about starting a startup, or you’re thinking about leading, do it and don't be afraid to trust and be yourself completely.</seg>
<seg id="56">I wish I knew that a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="57">And learn from my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="58">If you find yourself fundraising on Sand Hill, needing to pump milk, go use their nice-ass mother’s rooms.</seg>
<seg id="59">Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="1">Satan, the beast crunching sinners’ bones in his subterranean lair.</seg>
<seg id="2">Lucifer, the fallen angel raging against the established order.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mephistopheles, the trickster striking deals with unsuspecting humans.</seg>
<seg id="4">These three divergent devils are all based on Satan of the Old Testament, an angelic member of God’s court who torments Job in the Book of Job.</seg>
<seg id="5">But unlike any of these literary devils, the Satan of the Bible was a relatively minor character, with scant information about his deeds or appearance.</seg>
<seg id="6">So how did he become the ultimate antagonist, with so many different forms?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the New Testament, Satan saw a little more action: tempting Jesus, using demons to possess people, and finally appearing as a giant dragon who is cast into hell.</seg>
<seg id="8">This last image particularly inspired medieval artists and writers, who depicted a scaled, shaggy-furred creature with overgrown toenails.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Michael Pacher’s painting of St. Augustine and the Devil, the devil appears as an upright lizard— with a second miniature face glinting on his rear and.</seg>
<seg id="10">The epitome of these monster Satans appeared in Italian poet Dante Alighieri’s “Inferno.” Encased in the ninth circle of hell, Dante’s Satan is a three-headed, bat-winged behemoth who feasts on sinners.</seg>
<seg id="11">But he’s also an object of pity: powerless as the panicked beating of his wings only encases him further in ice.</seg>
<seg id="12">The poem’s protagonist escapes from hell by clambering over Satan’s body, and feels both disgust and sympathy for the trapped beast— prompting the reader to consider the pain of doing evil.</seg>
<seg id="13">By the Renaissance, the devil started to assume a more human form.</seg>
<seg id="14">Artists painted him as a man with cloven hooves and curling horns inspired by Pan, the Greek god of the wild.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his 1667 masterpiece “Paradise Lost,” English poet John Milton depicted the devil as Lucifer, an angel who started a rebellion on the grounds that God is too powerful.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kicked out of heaven, this charismatic rebel becomes Satan, and declares that he’d rather rule in hell than serve in heaven.</seg>
<seg id="17">Milton’s take inspired numerous depictions of Lucifer as an ambiguous figure, rather than a purely evil one.</seg>
<seg id="18">Milton’s Lucifer later became an iconic character for the Romantics of the 1800s, who saw him as a hero who defied higher power in pursuit of essential truths, with tragic consequences.</seg>
<seg id="19">Meanwhile, in the German legend of Doctor Faust, which dates to the 16th century, we get a look at what happens when the devil comes to Earth.</seg>
<seg id="20">Faust, a dissatisfied scholar, pledges his soul to the devil in exchange for bottomless pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="21">With the help of the devil’s messenger Mephistopheles, Faust quickly seizes women, power, and money— only to fall into the eternal fires of hell.</seg>
<seg id="22">Later versions of the story show Mephistopheles in different lights.</seg>
<seg id="23">In Christopher Marlowe's account, a cynical Doctor Faustus is happy to strike a deal with Mephistopheles.</seg>
<seg id="24">In Johann Wolfgang van Goethe’s version, Mephistopheles tricks Faust into a grisly deal.</seg>
<seg id="25">Today, a Faustian bargain refers to a trade that sacrifices integrity for short-term gains.</seg>
<seg id="26">In stagings of Goethe’s play, Mephistopheles appeared in red tights and cape.</seg>
<seg id="27">This version of the devil was often played as a charming trickster— one that eventually paraded through comic books, advertising, and film in his red suit.</seg>
<seg id="28">These three takes on the devil are just the tip of the iceberg: the devil continues to stalk the public imagination to this day, tempting artists of all kinds to render him according to new and fantastical visions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Every 24 hours, wind generates enough kinetic energy to produce roughly 35 times more electricity than humanity uses each day.</seg>
<seg id="2">And unlike coal or oil, this resource is totally renewed each day.</seg>
<seg id="3">So how can we harness this incredible amount of energy, and is it possible to create a world powered entirely by wind?</seg>
<seg id="4">The basic principle of wind energy is simple.</seg>
<seg id="5">A series of sails or blades mounted around a rotor catch the wind and translate its kinetic energy into rotational energy.</seg>
<seg id="6">Traditional windmills use that rotational energy to grind wheat or pump water.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in modern wind turbines, it turns a generator that creates electricity.</seg>
<seg id="8">This conversion from wind to rotational energy to electricity has defined wind turbines since their invention in the late 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="9">And there are three primary factors that determine just how much energy they can produce: the size and orientation of the blades, the blade’s aerodynamic design, and the amount of wind turning the rotor.</seg>
<seg id="10">First up, blade orientation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Wind turbines can be designed with their rotor on a vertical axis or a horizontal axis.</seg>
<seg id="12">Vertical blades can pick up wind coming from any direction, but with much less efficiency than horizontal axis rotors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Horizontal designs allow blades to capture the wind’s full force by tracking the wind’s direction and turning to face it.</seg>
<seg id="14">This turning process is called yawing, and older windmills achieved it through manual monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="15">Today, wind sensors and computer systems automatically adjust the blades with expert precision to capture as much energy as possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">Outside rotor orientation, the blades themselves need to be shaped to maximize efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="17">While early designs used flat blades, modern blades are curved like airplane wings.</seg>
<seg id="18">Wind travels faster over the curved surface, creating a low-pressure pocket above the blade that forces it upwards.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the amount of lift depends on the angle at which the wind is moving relative to the blade, modern blades also incorporate a twist, optimizing how much of the blade can cut into the wind.</seg>
<seg id="20">Made of fiberglass and resin layers, these blades are strong enough to operate through rain, lightning, and blistering sunlight for over 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even with aerodynamic blades and a horizontal rotor, a wind turbine can only capture wind if it's in a windy environment.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wind speeds typically increase the higher into the atmosphere you travel.</seg>
<seg id="23">So today, most turbines are well over 100 meters tall, with equally large rotor diameters.</seg>
<seg id="24">A turbine of this height and size can capture a huge amount of wind, generating enough electricity every year to power 750 American homes.</seg>
<seg id="25">A wind farm of 200 similarly sized turbines could power over 150,000 American homes— or twice as many European homes— for an entire year.</seg>
<seg id="26">Offshore wind farms contain an even greater number of even larger turbines.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2019, the largest wind turbine ever built began operating off the coast of the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="28">With a rotor diameter of 220 meters, just one of these turbines can meet the annual power needs of 16,000 European households.</seg>
<seg id="29">Despite its amazing potential, wind energy still faces challenges.</seg>
<seg id="30">Wind may be a free and unlimited fuel, but no matter how large or efficient a turbine is there's a mathematical limit to how much wind it can convert into electricity.</seg>
<seg id="31">German physicist Albert Betz calculated that since some wind must remain to keep the blades spinning, a turbine can only ever capture 59.3% of the wind’s energy.</seg>
<seg id="32">Additionally, some people feel turbines disrupt natural scenery, and wind energy’s intermittent availability can make it difficult to integrate into electrical grids.</seg>
<seg id="33">But even with these challenges, modern wind turbines have made wind energy the most efficient and inexpensive source of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="34">Wind turbines already provide essential energy for communities around the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">And for many farmers, hosting a wind turbine can be a reliable source of additional income.</seg>
<seg id="36">With continued improvements in wind forecasting, electrical grid infrastructure and energy storage, wind power might blow away all our energy problems.</seg>

<seg id="1">“Dictionary:” noun, “a malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language and making it hard and inelastic.” “Lexicographer:” noun, “a writer of dictionaries; a harmless drudge.” While the concept of a dictionary dates back to ancient civilizations, the first English dictionary was published by Robert Cawdrey in 1604.</seg>
<seg id="2">In the centuries that followed, many more dictionaries were written by individual authors who chose what to include or exclude.</seg>
<seg id="3">They not only defined words, they openly showcased their creators’ opinions— like Ambrose Bierce’s definition of “dictionary” and Samuel Johnson’s definition of “lexicographer.” After their authors deaths, many of these dictionaries quickly became outdated.</seg>
<seg id="4">But one 19th century dictionary had a different fate.</seg>
<seg id="5">In 1828, American lawyer and author Noah Webster published “An American Dictionary of the English Language” with a lofty goal: to give the United States its own version of the English language.</seg>
<seg id="6">He believed that as a new nation, the United States needed its own distinct version of English to assert its independence from Britain.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his dictionary, Webster sought to describe and officialize the way Americans spoke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most dictionaries in Webster’s time were prescriptive: they dictated how words should be used, rather than documenting the way people actually used language in daily life.</seg>
<seg id="9">When Webster broke this convention and included slang words in his dictionary, critics accused him of polluting the English language.</seg>
<seg id="10">But he argued that these words captured local variations of language— a vital part of what made American English unique.</seg>
<seg id="11">He also believed spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, and that we should write the way we speak as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="12">Still, Webster’s own opinions influenced the words he included and the way he defined them.</seg>
<seg id="13">He excluded slang words from Black communities because he didn’t consider them proper.</seg>
<seg id="14">And when he defined “woman,” he added that “women are soft, mild, pitiful, and flexible.” By the time of his death, Noah Webster was a household name.</seg>
<seg id="15">Seeing a lucrative business opportunity, brothers George and Charles Merriam bought the rights to Webster’s Dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="16">Together with Webster’s son-in-law, the Merriams made a new, revised edition.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was the beginning of the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="18">Today, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary begins to address a contradiction in Webster’s goal: he wanted to represent an entire nation, but he based his work on just one person’s opinion: his own.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since Webster’s death, each new edition of the dictionary has been curated by a group of language experts rather than by a single authority.</seg>
<seg id="20">The current criteria for including a word in the dictionary are that it has “widespread, sustained, and meaningful use.” This clearly includes profanities, which were sometimes excluded from dictionaries in the past.</seg>
<seg id="21">Racial slurs also meet the criteria for inclusion, but some argue that including them might legitimize them.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dictionaries don’t just add new words— they also redefine old words to reflect changing attitudes and usage.</seg>
<seg id="23">One 1736 dictionary defined “wife” as “a married woman whose will, in the judgment of the law, is subject to the will of her husband: for which reason a wife is said to have no will.” Today, “wife” is defined simply as “a female partner in a marriage.” In 2019, Merriam-Webster’s word of the year was “they.” The word has been in regular use for centuries, but has only recently gained a new recognized meaning, as a pronoun for one person whose gender identity is nonbinary.</seg>
<seg id="24">The question of which words belong in the dictionary impacts all of us— when our words and definitions are represented, they’re affirmed; if not, they— and we— are minimized.</seg>
<seg id="25">Today, lexicographers have expanded word sourcing to include the dictionary’s users: tracking which words are most searched, and adding them to the dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="26">So, who decides what’s in the dictionary?</seg>
<seg id="27">More than ever before the answer is: we do.</seg>
<seg id="28">All of us shape language every day.</seg>
<seg id="29">When we collectively embrace one word or redefine another, eventually, those words and meanings are reflected in our dictionaries.</seg>

<seg id="1">[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE] A decade ago, after a peaceful revolution toppled the longtime Tunisian dictator Ben Ali, I was sitting in an orange grove outside of Athens, Greece.</seg>
<seg id="2">Undocumented migrants were hiding there.</seg>
<seg id="3">I came to interview them about human rights abuses they had suffered while entering Europe.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of them, a Tunisian fellow in a leather jacket, explained.</seg>
<seg id="5">The people who overthrew Ben Ali, they want democracy and a dignified life.</seg>
<seg id="6">“We, who have crossed the Mediterranean, want democracy and a dignified life.” What is the difference?</seg>
<seg id="7">The migrant is a kind of revolutionary.</seg>
<seg id="8">This idea stuck with me and informed my work as a lawyer and a scholar ever since.</seg>
<seg id="9">As Middle Eastern revolutions turned into civil wars, the refugee crisis unfolded in the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="10">This exacerbated political pressures against asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Initially, the European Court of Human Rights took a strong stand against border violence.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 2012, the court decided that Italy cannot turn asylum seekers back from the Mediterranean to dangerous Libyan territory, without first hearing them.</seg>
<seg id="13">The human rights community cheered.</seg>
<seg id="14">I was not one of those who cheered.</seg>
<seg id="15">In my scholarship, I predicted that this kind of decision could also generate bad results.</seg>
<seg id="16">States determined to enforce their own borders could turn back asylum seekers even before they enter the supervision of their own courts.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was regretfully correct.</seg>
<seg id="18">In recent years, the Italians have relied on Libyan militias to do their dirty work.</seg>
<seg id="19">So eager are some European governments to ditch their own human rights obligations, they've equipped and armed Libyan militia, ignoring their rampant use of torture.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is also why, since January 2014, more than 34,000 migrants have died by drowning in the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="21">And since COVID-19 began, the militarized border in the Mediterranean has become in some ways even more extreme.</seg>
<seg id="22">But how does the militarized border cause deaths by drowning?</seg>
<seg id="23">I'd like to illustrate by a reference to a case I'm currently working on.</seg>
<seg id="24">On November 6, 2017, a group of asylum seekers left the Libyan coast and traveled through the Mediterranean, hoping to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="25">As the overcrowded boat started to break down, they sent a distress signal, and under international law, states are obligated to facilitate the rescue of vessels in distress.</seg>
<seg id="26">Now, a strange confrontation followed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two vessels, not one, came to pick up the asylum seekers in distress.</seg>
<seg id="28">One of them was sailing under a European flag, its crew in civilian clothing.</seg>
<seg id="29">The other was a Libyan vessel with its crew armed and in the very uniform of the government that these people had fled.</seg>
<seg id="30">For the asylum seekers, the choice was clear.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many jumped into the water, determined at all costs not to let the Libyans pick them up.</seg>
<seg id="32">Twenty people drowned, victims of a contemporary struggle for liberation across borders.</seg>
<seg id="33">What I didn't predict a few years back was the courageous response of civil society volunteers such as members of Sea-Watch, who have literally inserted their bodies between the Libyan forces and the migrants in the water.</seg>
<seg id="34">Crucially, they've also brought back images from cameras on board and body cams.</seg>
<seg id="35">These images allowed my colleagues, Charles Heller and Lorenzo Pezzani to visually reconstruct the events of November 2017.</seg>
<seg id="36">When they came to my team and me asking that we go back to the European Court of Human Rights, I was hesitant.</seg>
<seg id="37">States always have ways to circumvent progressive human rights decisions, but the evidence spoke for itself.</seg>
<seg id="38">With my colleagues Violeta Moreno-Lax and Loredana Leo, we filed the case at the European Court of Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="39">We argue that Italy, as well as Europe, cannot rely on Libyan militia to sidestep their own accountability.</seg>
<seg id="40">On a high level of generality, the question is when is a point of contact established between a person in need of protection and a state that can protect them.</seg>
<seg id="41">I've called this moment the human rights encounter.</seg>
<seg id="42">It is a dramatic moment in which legal commitments are put to an existential test.</seg>
<seg id="43">It's not about human rights law generally, but a particular person in a particular time.</seg>
<seg id="44">About simple commitments we have to each other as persons.</seg>
<seg id="45">It is not merely by chance that the sea becomes the environment for this large-scale struggle for liberation across borders.</seg>
<seg id="46">As for the court, it has recognized the human rights encounter, when it's physical and direct.</seg>
<seg id="47">In the case I just told you about, we go further.</seg>
<seg id="48">Even when mediated by technology or by proxy forces, the underlying commitments to human rights should not change.</seg>
<seg id="49">In my organization, the Global Legal Action Network, we pursue this case I told you about as part of a strategic litigation program.</seg>
<seg id="50">We consider international law and the laws of many countries.</seg>
<seg id="51">We collaborate with researchers and activists who use cutting edge technologies to document violations across many borders.</seg>
<seg id="52">As war, persecution and climate change continue, we believe this strategy will redefine the future of human rights lawyering.</seg>
<seg id="53">The future of human rights lawyering is not only about a struggle against one corrupt leader or another.</seg>
<seg id="54">It's also about questions concerning how do we all inhabit this planet together?</seg>

<seg id="1">[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE] It’s a warm morning and I’m surrounded by six-year-old children in a classroom.</seg>
<seg id="2">One by one, they cheerfully hug one of their friends who just came back home from a trip.</seg>
<seg id="3">They comment on her new dress and her new hairstyle.</seg>
<seg id="4">But the girl does nothing.</seg>
<seg id="5">She looks towards the distant horizon, eyes fixed.</seg>
<seg id="6">The kids start wondering why she doesn't speak.</seg>
<seg id="7">The girl's name is Adayanci, and the trip she has just returned from is not a vacation.</seg>
<seg id="8">She left Guatemala with her dad in May 2018 for the United States.</seg>
<seg id="9">Several months later, she's back, but she has gone silent.</seg>
<seg id="10">I'm filming this, feeling overwhelmed, and finding it difficult to look through the viewfinder of my camera.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her post-traumatic stress disorder is so visible.</seg>
<seg id="12">I am in tears.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am a journalist who documents aftermaths for a living.</seg>
<seg id="14">The impact, the invisible consequences.</seg>
<seg id="15">What happens when the media spotlight is gone?</seg>
<seg id="16">That's why I've spent hundreds of hours listening to and watching people deeply affected by trauma.</seg>
<seg id="17">Survivors of trafficking, child rape, gang slavery, forced labor and immigration enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="18">Different from the job of psychiatrist and aid workers, I've dedicated my life to listening to them to make their stories public, in first person, in their own voice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Despite all of the limitations of words and photographs and films, I believe better stories about the effects of trauma in people's lives are essential.</seg>
<seg id="20">They can show us the real consequences of seemingly abstract government policies.</seg>
<seg id="21">They can trigger understanding across political divides and awaken our universal sense of empathy.</seg>
<seg id="22">Survivors like the now deceased Jennifer taught me that brutal bondage does not happen far away.</seg>
<seg id="23">David taught me the horrors refugees flee from are scarier than any obstacle in the quest for safety.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adayanci brought home for me that governments of developed nations also harm using trauma as a weapon.</seg>
<seg id="25">The word "trauma" comes from ancient Greek.</seg>
<seg id="26">It's the word for "injury".</seg>
<seg id="27">It's the psychological wound that stays after something really terrible has happened to us.</seg>
<seg id="28">It affects our body, our mind, our memory and our sense of safety in the world.</seg>
<seg id="29">War, violence, kidnapping, torture, they are all causes of trauma.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it does not only happen far away, far from you.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the United States, for example, several large-scale community studies have shown that exposure to violence and terror, like rape, domestic abuse or trafficking are common and damaging in times of peace.</seg>
<seg id="32">What I witnessed in that classroom in Guatemala was the aftermath of the zero-tolerance policy.</seg>
<seg id="33">It separated children from parents at the US-Mexico border.</seg>
<seg id="34">Adayanci was sent to a shelter and two foster families while her dad was deported.</seg>
<seg id="35">In her despair, she took a pair of scissors and cut her own hair as a form of protest.</seg>
<seg id="36">A psychologist diagnosed her with acute stress, warning it would become post-traumatic stress disorder the longer time passed.</seg>
<seg id="37">The damage of this type of separation at an early age, just like other forms of abuse, can be permanent if the child doesn't receive help.</seg>
<seg id="38">In order to justify this kind of violence, there is a will to make certain people seem very different from us.</seg>
<seg id="39">Evil, rapists, animals, criminals.</seg>
<seg id="40">Stripping off their humanity is a deliberate technique used by governments with plenty of examples in history books.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this case, the so-called evil, criminal and animal was a shattered six-year-old girl.</seg>
<seg id="42">We published Adayanci's documentary.</seg>
<seg id="43">The story won a World Press Photo award thanks to which Adayanci is receiving therapy in Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="44">She's on her slow way back to recovery, dancing and daydreaming.</seg>
<seg id="45">But most others have not gotten access to care.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hundreds haven't even been reunited with their families.</seg>
<seg id="47">The trauma these policies cost can have generational effects.</seg>
<seg id="48">Even in Adayanci's fortunate case, the family has no institutional support and is in deep debt.</seg>
<seg id="49">We humans heal from trauma through feeling safe, through storytelling and through establishing connection with others in our communities.</seg>
<seg id="50">For this little girl reframing the story she will tell herself it's part of her healing.</seg>
<seg id="51">For us as a society, reframing her story and pressuring our governments to do better is part of reclaiming our dignity as equals.</seg>

<seg id="1">A samurai is found dead in a quiet bamboo grove.</seg>
<seg id="2">One by one, the crime’s only known witnesses recount their version of the events that transpired.</seg>
<seg id="3">But as they each tell their tale, it becomes clear that every testimony is plausible, yet different.</seg>
<seg id="4">And each witness implicates themselves.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the premise of “In a Grove,” a short story published in the early 1920s by Japanese author Ryūnosuke Akutagawa.</seg>
<seg id="6">Though many know this tale of warring perspectives by a different name: “Rashomon.” In 1950, Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa adapted two of Akutagawa’s stories into one film.</seg>
<seg id="7">This movie introduced the world to an enduring cultural metaphor that has transformed our understanding of truth, justice and human memory.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Rashomon effect describes a situation in which individuals give significantly different but equally conceivable accounts of the same event.</seg>
<seg id="9">Often used to highlight the unreliability of eyewitnesses, the Rashomon effect usually occurs under two specific conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">The first: there’s no evidence to verify what really happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the second: there’s pressure to achieve closure, often provided by an authority figure trying to identify the definitive truth.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the Rashomon effect undermines the very idea of a singular, objective truth.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the source material, Akutagawa and Kurosawa use the tools of their media to give each character’s testimony equal weight, transforming each witness into an unreliable narrator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Without any hints on who’s sharing the most accurate account, the audience can’t tell which character to trust.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, each testimony takes on a truthful quality, and the audience is left doubting their convictions as they guess who ended the samurai’s life.</seg>
<seg id="16">Some might find this frustrating because the plot subverts expectations of how mysteries usually end.</seg>
<seg id="17">But by refusing to provide a clear answer, these two artists capture the messiness and complexity of truth and human memory.</seg>
<seg id="18">Neuroscientists have found that when we form a memory, our interpretation of visual information is influenced by our previous experiences and internal biases.</seg>
<seg id="19">Some of these biases are unique to individuals, but others are more universal.</seg>
<seg id="20">For example, egocentric bias can influence people to subconsciously reshape their memories in ways that cast a positive light on their actions.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even if we were able to encode a memory accurately, recalling it incorporates new information that changes the memory.</seg>
<seg id="22">And when we later recall that event, we typically remember the embellished memory instead of the original experience.</seg>
<seg id="23">These underlying psychological phenomena mean that the Rashomon effect can pop up anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="24">In biology, scientists starting from the same dataset and applying the same analytical methods, frequently publish different results.</seg>
<seg id="25">Anthropologists regularly grapple with the impact personal backgrounds can have on an expert's perception.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one famous case, two anthropologists visited the Mexican village of Tepoztlan.</seg>
<seg id="27">The first researcher described life in the town as happy and contented, while the second recorded residents as paranoid and disgruntled.</seg>
<seg id="28">Experts aside, the Rashomon effect can also impact the general public, particularly when it comes to the perception of complicated world events.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, following a 2015 security summit between the United States and leaders from the Arab States, media reports about the summit varied enormously.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some stated that it had gone smoothly, while others called it a complete failure.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's tempting to fixate on why we have competing perceptions, but perhaps the more important question the Rashomon effect raises is, what is truth anyway?</seg>
<seg id="32">Are there situations when an “objective truth” doesn’t exist?</seg>
<seg id="33">What can different versions of the same event tell us about the time, place and people involved?</seg>
<seg id="34">And how can we make group decisions if we’re all working with different information, backgrounds, and biases?</seg>
<seg id="35">Like most questions, these don’t have a definitive answer.</seg>
<seg id="36">But the enduring importance of Akutagawa’s story suggests there may be value in embracing the ambiguity.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Warsaw, late October 1943, Irena Sendler and Janina Grabowska were enjoying a rare moment of peace in their war-torn city.</seg>
<seg id="2">But their laughter froze when they heard the Gestapo pounding on Sendler’s door.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sendler rushed to the window to dispose of incriminating evidence— only to see more police patrolling below.</seg>
<seg id="4">Knowing she was minutes from arrest, she tossed Janina her most dangerous possession: a glass jar containing the names of over 2,000 Jewish children she’d smuggled to safety.</seg>
<seg id="5">This arrest wasn’t the first consequence Sendler had faced in her lifelong crusade against anti-Semitism.</seg>
<seg id="6">Born to Catholic parents in 1910, she grew up in a predominantly Jewish town where her father treated poor Jewish patients other doctors refused to help.</seg>
<seg id="7">Irena was furious at the constant discrimination against her Jewish friends.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a graduate student in social welfare at the University of Warsaw, Sendler publicly denounced the segregation of classrooms and defaced her non-Jewish identity card— earning her a suspension and a reputation for troublemaking.</seg>
<seg id="9">Buoyed by her socialist ideals and inspired by her fellow social workers, Sendler assisted vulnerable Jewish families across Warsaw, pushing back on the waves of anti-Semitism surging through Europe.</seg>
<seg id="10">But in September 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland, bringing laws that further eroded Jewish rights.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 1940, Hitler announced that hundreds of thousands of Jews in Warsaw were to be forced into just over one square mile of land.</seg>
<seg id="12">Bordered by high walls and subject to constant surveillance, families living in the Warsaw Ghetto quickly became starving and sick.</seg>
<seg id="13">Appalled, Sendler and her colleagues secured passes to the ghetto on the pretense of checking for typhus outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="14">At first, her group worked to smuggle in resources with the help of sympathetic Polish officials and the medical underground.</seg>
<seg id="15">But as desperate parents began sending their children through sewers and over walls, it became clear that to help these people survive, Sendler needed to help them escape.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sendler and her associates developed a coordinated campaign of rescue missions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Children were bundled into dirty laundry, packed into boxes on cargo trains, and carried beneath the Gestapo’s noses in coffins, toolboxes, and briefcases.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bigger children escaped through the courthouse and church, which straddled the ghetto’s boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sendler helped ferry these children to safe houses, before forging them new documents and sending them to orphanages, convents, and foster families across Poland.</seg>
<seg id="20">To retain their Jewish identities and keep track of every child, Sendler kept painstaking records on thin cigarette paper and stored them in glass jars.</seg>
<seg id="21">This work was punishable by death.</seg>
<seg id="22">But for Sendler, such consequences paled in comparison to the pain of convincing parents to part with their children— often with no promise of a reunion.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 1942, the Nazis began transporting Jews from the ghetto into concentration camps.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sendler worked with new urgency, joining forces with the Nazi resistance group called Zegota.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zegota helped Sendler expand her operation by stashing money for her in post boxes across Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="26">But this system would also be Sendler’s downfall.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the Gestapo threatened a laundry owner whose business contained a Zegota post box, she gave them Sendler’s name.</seg>
<seg id="28">At 3am on October 20th, the Gestapo burst into Sendler’s apartment, arresting her for aiding Jews throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police had captured Sendler, but her records remained safe.</seg>
<seg id="30">Janina protected the children’s names with her life, all without knowing whether her friend would ever return.</seg>
<seg id="31">Despite enduring months of physical and psychological torture, Sendler betrayed no information.</seg>
<seg id="32">Defiant to the end, she was sentenced to execution on January 20th, 1944.</seg>
<seg id="33">But as she walked to her death, a German officer diverted her course.</seg>
<seg id="34">Zegota had paid the Gestapo the modern equivalent of over $100,000 for Sendler’s release.</seg>
<seg id="35">That night as she listened to bullhorns proclaiming her death, Sendler’s work began anew.</seg>
<seg id="36">Remaining in hiding, she continued to oversee Zegota’s rescue missions until Germany’s defeat in 1945.</seg>
<seg id="37">After the war, Sendler reconnected with the children she’d helped escape, remaining in contact with many for the rest of her life.</seg>
<seg id="38">And while the new Polish government sought to suppress her story, the children she rescued ensured she was recognized for her work.</seg>
<seg id="39">Yet despite all the lives she saved, Sendler remained hesitant to accept praise for her actions, remarking, “I continue to have qualms of conscience that I did so little.”</seg>

<seg id="1">After the California Gold Rush of 1848, white settlers streamed west to strike it rich.</seg>
<seg id="2">In addition to precious metals, they unearthed another treasure: dinosaur bones.</seg>
<seg id="3">Two wealthy scientists in particular— Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope— competed to uncover these prehistoric monsters.</seg>
<seg id="4">Marsh and Cope were first to describe iconic creatures like Brontosaurus, Triceratops, and Stegosaurus.</seg>
<seg id="5">But they also showcased the destructive whirlwind of profiteering and ambition that fueled American science during the late 1800s.</seg>
<seg id="6">Their rivalry, one of the most notorious scientific feuds in history, became known as the Bone Wars.</seg>
<seg id="7">Marsh was ill-tempered and had a knack for debunking falsehoods.</seg>
<seg id="8">One woman said that getting to know him was “like running against a pitchfork.” Cope, on the other hand, was charismatic and given to bold theorizing.</seg>
<seg id="9">But he was also sarcastic and temperamental.</seg>
<seg id="10">By his own admission, he wasn’t “constructed for getting along comfortably with the general run of people.” When Marsh and Cope first met in 1864, they were friendly, and each named a new species in the other’s honor.</seg>
<seg id="11">But their relationship soon soured.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 1868, Cope took Marsh to a quarry near his home in New Jersey where one of the most complete dinosaur skeletons to date had recently been discovered.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sensing an opportunity, Marsh paid the mine operators to send him the most interesting new finds.</seg>
<seg id="14">Outraged, Cope accused Marsh of bribery.</seg>
<seg id="15">That same year, Cope showed Marsh his reconstruction of a new marine reptile called Elasmosaurus.</seg>
<seg id="16">Marsh immediately noticed that something was wrong: Cope had mistaken the creature’s long neck for its tail.</seg>
<seg id="17">When Cope's mentor sided with Marsh, Cope was mortified.</seg>
<seg id="18">He tried to buy and destroy every copy of the article containing his blunder, but to no avail.</seg>
<seg id="19">Their mutual resentment blossomed.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the transcontinental railroad was completed the following year, Cope and Marsh began scouring the American West for fossils.</seg>
<seg id="21">They found riches the likes of which neither had dreamed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Relying on the help of Native American guides, Marsh made some especially significant discoveries, like ancient birds with teeth that are still celebrated as a missing link between dinosaurs and modern birds.</seg>
<seg id="23">Cope made important discoveries, too, but Marsh successfully invalidated many of them, showing them to be redundant with other known species.</seg>
<seg id="24">Enraged, Cope tried to secure priority for new findings by announcing them via telegram.</seg>
<seg id="25">He even purchased a respected journal so future publications could be rushed into print.</seg>
<seg id="26">But Marsh used his personal fortune to gain the upper hand, hiring a small army of fossil hunters to out-compete his rival.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 1878, Marsh bought an especially promising quarry in Como Bluff, Wyoming, from two frontier collectors.</seg>
<seg id="28">It yielded tons of fossils, including the near-complete skeleton of a gigantic dinosaur that Marsh named Brontosaurus.</seg>
<seg id="29">Over the next 10 years, his men shipped him more than 480 boxes of dinosaur bones from Como alone.</seg>
<seg id="30">Marsh named dozens of new species.</seg>
<seg id="31">But his assistants could be ruthless in their quest to further Marsh’s scientific ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">They sometimes destroyed fossils just to prevent them from falling into Cope’s hands.</seg>
<seg id="33">Desperate to catch up with Marsh, Cope invested his dwindling fortune into silver mining.</seg>
<seg id="34">The gamble failed, and he was left nearly destitute.</seg>
<seg id="35">While Cope contemplated selling his precious collection, Marsh was named lead paleontologist for the US Geological Survey.</seg>
<seg id="36">This well-funded branch of the government often sponsored Westward expeditions, giving Marsh even more resources to vanquish his rival.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Bone Wars spilled into public view when Cope had a tabloid newspaper publish an article accusing Marsh of plagiarism, fraud, and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="38">Marsh fired back and the two further tarnished each other’s reputations.</seg>
<seg id="39">Neither ever relented.</seg>
<seg id="40">When Cope died, he donated his skull to science, hoping to prove that his brain was larger than that of his enemy.</seg>
<seg id="41">Marsh never accepted the challenge.</seg>
<seg id="42">Although Marsh named more species than Cope, both men greatly expanded our understanding of evolution.</seg>
<seg id="43">But their egotistical one-upmanship reminds us that, in spite of its ideals, science is a personal enterprise conducted by individual— and at times deeply flawed— human beings.</seg>

<seg id="1">On a small island in the middle of the Irish Sea, fortresses preside over the rugged shores.</seg>
<seg id="2">This unlikely location was the birthplace of a medieval empire that lasted 200 years, ruled by a dynasty of sea kings.</seg>
<seg id="3">The first of these kings was Godred Crovan, a notorious warlord descended from Irish and Viking rulers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Starting in 1079, Godred consolidated power over the Isle of Man and the Hebrides, a collection of islands off the west coast of Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="5">He seized control of important sea routes between the British Isles, Scandinavia, and the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="6">A turbulent period followed Godred’s death, characterised by invasions from Norway and Ireland, and intense feuding between princes.</seg>
<seg id="7">But his descendants held on to power, building coastal fortresses, roving the seaways, throwing themselves into epic battles, and consolidating control over an impressive maritime kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="8">The inhabitants of this kingdom had both Gaelic and Norse roots, and many probably spoke both languages.</seg>
<seg id="9">Those on the Isle of Man were known as the Manx people, while those in the Hebrides were known as Islanders or People of the Isles.</seg>
<seg id="10">Though we still don’t know for sure how many there were, we do know this relatively small group had an outsize impact on the region.</seg>
<seg id="11">Perched on cliffs with sweeping views and safe harbors, seaside fortresses helped the kings control shipping, commerce, and resources.</seg>
<seg id="12">The empire commanded vast fleets of Viking-style long ships, which they used for trading, raiding, and plundering the seas.</seg>
<seg id="13">Observing this prowess, many neighboring rulers sought their aid.</seg>
<seg id="14">The brothers Rognvald and Olaf each solved neighbors’ maritime woes: King Rognvald supplied military assistance to the Scottish king, and King Olaf’s forces served as a Coast Guard at the English King Henry III’s request— for a hefty fee.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sea kings also sparred with their powerful neighbors, but they had a particularly bitter rivalry with another dynasty in their own isles: a line of rulers in the Hebrides.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the 1150s, a chieftain of this line, Somerled, defeated the Manx King, his brother-in-law, in a naval battle and formed a rival Kingdom of the Isles, fracturing the old kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="17">This began a century-long rivalry between Somerled’s line, who ruled the southern and central Hebrides, and the Manx Kings, who ruled the Isle of Man and northern Hebrides, to control the seaways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Family feuds often blossomed into bitter civil wars.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 1223, King Rognvald sent a letter to his son commanding him to murder his uncle Olaf.</seg>
<seg id="20">When Olaf discovered the plot, he launched a vicious attack on his nephew, blinding and mutilating him.</seg>
<seg id="21">After Rognvald’s death several years later, people realized the letter ordering the attack might have been forged.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Manx kings attempted to resolve disagreements at Tynwald, an open-air parliament centered on a mound, where assemblies ruled on matters of justice and other issues.</seg>
<seg id="23">Such sites were commonly used in the Viking world for resolving anything from local disputes to matters involving kings.</seg>
<seg id="24">These meetings didn’t always go smoothly— sometimes violence erupted, and in 1237, two rival factions squabbled to the point of breaking up the assembly at Tynwald.</seg>
<seg id="25">The four-tiered mound at Tynwald survives to this day, and the modern Manx parliament still holds an annual meeting there.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 1248, King Harald of Man died in a shipwreck and was succeeded by his brother.</seg>
<seg id="27">Weeks into the new king’s reign, a rebel knight assassinated him.</seg>
<seg id="28">His brother Magnus died in 1265 at Castle Rushen— without an heir.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to one scribe, his death marked the day that “kings ceased to reign in Man.” Scotland annexed Man and the Isles the next year, in 1266.</seg>
<seg id="30">We know about the exploits of the sea kings primarily from a chronicle written by Christian scribes living on the Isle of Man, and from the praise poems composed to celebrate the kings’ victories.</seg>
<seg id="31">Today, although the sea kings are long gone, their presence remains etched onto the landscape.</seg>

<seg id="1">What if I told you that the pandemic will save the lives of millions of people?</seg>
<seg id="2">It's a difficult thing to consider, given how many loved ones we've already lost.</seg>
<seg id="3">But throughout the course of human history, massive public health crises have resulted in innovation in health care and technology.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, the Black Death gave rise to the Gutenberg press and the 1918 flu pandemic led to modern vaccine technology.</seg>
<seg id="5">The COVID-19 pandemic has and will be no different.</seg>
<seg id="6">Just look at our vaccines -- normally developed over many years, and the mRNA vaccines were deployed in a mind-blowing 11 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">How is that even possible?</seg>
<seg id="8">It was possible because scientists have been working for many years to get us to the point where we could use mRNA quickly in an emergency situation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Specifically, we've been working on how to help mRNA with its biggest problem, which is that it doesn't normally go to the right places inside of our bodies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fortunately, we got around that problem just in time, and I'd like to tell you about the technology that we use to do it.</seg>
<seg id="11">When mRNA is administered, it's injected into our muscles or our bloodstream, but we actually need it to go inside of our cells.</seg>
<seg id="12">Unfortunately, mRNA is fragile, and our bodies will destroy it before it goes very far.</seg>
<seg id="13">You can think of mRNA like a glass vase that you'd like to send in the mail without a box and bubble wrap.</seg>
<seg id="14">And without an address on the box, your postal delivery service will have no idea where to take it.</seg>
<seg id="15">And so if we're going to use mRNA as a therapeutic, it needs our help.</seg>
<seg id="16">It needs protection, and it needs to be told where to go.</seg>
<seg id="17">And that's where I come in.</seg>
<seg id="18">For over five decades, scientists and engineers like myself have been creating the shipping materials for nucleic acid drugs, like DNA and RNA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Through trial and error, we've created packages that deliver intact vases to the wrong address; that delivered to the right address but with a broken vase; packages that get ripped apart by attacking dogs; and packages that throw out the mail carrier's back.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's taken many years to get the science right.</seg>
<seg id="21">Let me show you the result, these tiny balls of fat that we call lipid nanoparticles.</seg>
<seg id="22">Let me tell you what they are and how they work.</seg>
<seg id="23">So first of all, "nano" just means really, really small.</seg>
<seg id="24">Think of how small a person is compared to the diameter of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="25">That's how small a nanoparticle is compared to the person.</seg>
<seg id="26">These nanoparticles are made up of several fatty molecules called lipids.</seg>
<seg id="27">Fat is an awesome packing material -- nice and bouncy.</seg>
<seg id="28">Interestingly, our cells are also surrounded by fat to keep them flexible and protected.</seg>
<seg id="29">Years ago, scientists had the idea to create lipid nanoparticles that would act like a Trojan horse.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the lipids in the nanoparticle look similar to the membranes that surround our cells, the cells are willing to bring the nanoparticle inside, and that's when the mRNA is released into the cell.</seg>
<seg id="31">So what, exactly, are the lipids in these nanoparticles?</seg>
<seg id="32">There are four ingredients in addition to the mRNA, and I'll tell you about each one.</seg>
<seg id="33">First, there's a lipid called a phospholipid.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is the primary ingredient in our cell membranes, which are the walls of fat that separate the insides of our cells from everything that surrounds them.</seg>
<seg id="35">Phospholipids have a head that likes water and a tail that likes other fatty things.</seg>
<seg id="36">So when you throw a bunch of phospholipids together in water, they form this beautiful structure called a lipid bilayer.</seg>
<seg id="37">Here, the heads face the inside and the outside of the cell, which is water, and the fat-loving parts of the molecule hang out together in the middle.</seg>
<seg id="38">In lipid nanoparticles, phospholipids have a similar role of keeping all of the other ingredients organized.</seg>
<seg id="39">Second, there's a lipid called cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="40">Why, if cholesterol has a bad reputation, would we want to use it in a therapeutic nanoparticle?</seg>
<seg id="41">It turns out that while cholesterol can be bad when it's in our bloodstream, it's actually a really good thing for our cell membranes.</seg>
<seg id="42">And that's because those phospholipids I just told you about, they are entirely too free with themselves, and they are prone to falling apart.</seg>
<seg id="43">Cholesterol is a stiff molecule that wedges itself in between the other lipids to fill in the gaps and hold them all together.</seg>
<seg id="44">It plays a similar role in our lipid nanoparticles.</seg>
<seg id="45">It provides structural support so the nanoparticles don't fall apart in between the injection and when they get into our cells.</seg>
<seg id="46">Third, there's a lipid called an ionizable lipid.</seg>
<seg id="47">Here, "ionizable" means that when these particles are in the bloodstream, they're neutrally charged, which helps with their safety.</seg>
<seg id="48">Then they switch to a positive charge inside of our cells, which helps them release the mRNA.</seg>
<seg id="49">Ionizable lipids are special because they have to be made in the lab, and scientists around the world have tested tens of thousands of these materials to find ones that are good at delivering mRNA safely.</seg>
<seg id="50">And because they're made in the lab, they tend to be proprietary to the company that invented them.</seg>
<seg id="51">So, for example, Moderna and BioNTech, the company that partnered with Pfizer, they discovered different ionizable lipids, and that is the only important ingredient in their COVID-19 vaccines that differ.</seg>
<seg id="52">And even then, their ionizable lipids aren't even that different, which is reassuring, because when independent groups of scientists converge on similar solutions, it's easier to trust the result.</seg>
<seg id="53">Finally, one more ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="54">This one is a polymer called polyethylene glycol.</seg>
<seg id="55">PEG is a water-loving molecule.</seg>
<seg id="56">So it surrounds the lipid nanoparticle and it holds it all together.</seg>
<seg id="57">You can think of the other three lipids as the box and the bubble wrap for the mRNA, and the PEG as the packing tape.</seg>
<seg id="58">You may have heard in the news about a tiny fraction of people that have allergic responses to the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="59">There is some evidence that PEG could be contributing to these allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="60">And that's because people are routinely exposed to PEG in cosmetic and household products, and some people have already developed antibodies against PEG.</seg>
<seg id="61">But why would this happen to some people and not to others?</seg>
<seg id="62">It turns out that every person's immune system is different, and just the same way that some people are allergic to latex, other people are allergic to PEG.</seg>
<seg id="63">It's important to keep in mind, however, that PEG has had a long history of safe use as part of FDA-approved drug formulations, and these vaccine allergies could be caused by things other than PEG.</seg>
<seg id="64">More research is needed to get to the bottom of these side effects.</seg>
<seg id="65">All right, so let's take a step back and look at our whole nanoparticle.</seg>
<seg id="66">Beautiful, right?</seg>
<seg id="67">When these ingredients all fit together nicely, the result is a deliverywoman's dream.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the case of the vaccines, after these nanoparticles get injected into our muscle, they take the mRNA into our cells.</seg>
<seg id="69">There, the mRNA acts like an instruction manual that tells our cells to make a foreign protein, in this case, the coronavirus spike protein.</seg>
<seg id="70">When our immune cells see the spike protein, they rush to protect us from it, and they teach themselves to remember it, so that they can kill it if it ever returns.</seg>
<seg id="71">As we speak, the mRNA vaccines are out there saving lives from the coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="72">They were our first and best tool to combat this nightmare, and they are our best hope of responding swiftly to viral variance because we can keep our lipid nanoparticle packaging the same, and all we have to do is swap out the mRNA that's inside.</seg>
<seg id="73">But here's the best part: for mRNA therapeutics, these vaccines are only the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="74">mRNA can be used to treat or cure many diseases.</seg>
<seg id="75">So in the future, we will likely have treatments for many terrible diseases, including cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia.</seg>
<seg id="76">These diseases are caused by mutated proteins, and we can use mRNA to ask our cells to make the correct version of these proteins.</seg>
<seg id="77">We'll have treatments for cancer -- breast, blood, lungs -- you name it.</seg>
<seg id="78">Here, we'll use mRNA to teach our immune cells how to find and kill cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="79">And then, if we're lucky, we'll have vaccines against some of the most deadly and feared pathogens across the globe, including malaria, Ebola and HIV.</seg>
<seg id="80">Some of these products are already in clinical trials, and the success of the COVID-19 vaccines will pave the way for future generations of these therapies.</seg>
<seg id="81">This is how the pandemic will save the lives of millions.</seg>
<seg id="82">It catalyzed the most rapid vaccine development in history and brought to life a niche, previously unapproved form of technology.</seg>
<seg id="83">And in our desperation, we gave that technology a chance.</seg>
<seg id="84">Now we're collecting long-term safety and efficacy data from hundreds of millions of people.</seg>
<seg id="85">And with these data, interest in the technology, funding for the technology and trust in the technology will continue to grow.</seg>
<seg id="86">Looking ahead, the packaging and delivery of mRNA to the right organs and tissues will continue to be one of the most significant challenges to implementing this technology.</seg>
<seg id="87">And so my colleagues and I are going to be busy for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="88">Ultimately, I'm here with a message of hope.</seg>
<seg id="89">We are on the cusp of a revolution.</seg>
<seg id="90">mRNA is about to change the world forever, and it's all thanks to these fatty little balls that take this miracle medicine to exactly where it's needed.</seg>

<talkid>80685</talkid>
<seg id="1">In the 20th century, most vaccines took well over a decade to research, test, and produce.</seg>
<seg id="2">But the vaccines for COVID-19 cleared the threshold for emergency use in less than 11 months.</seg>
<seg id="3">The secret behind this speed is a medical technology that’s been developing for decades: the mRNA vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="4">This new treatment uses our body’s existing cellular machinery to trigger an immune response, protecting us from viruses without ever experiencing an infection.</seg>
<seg id="5">And in the future, this approach might be able to treat new diseases almost as quickly as they emerge.</seg>
<seg id="6">So how do these revolutionary vaccines work?</seg>
<seg id="7">The key ingredient is in the name.</seg>
<seg id="8">mRNA, or messenger ribonucleic acid, is a naturally occurring molecule that encodes the instructions for producing proteins.</seg>
<seg id="9">When our cells process mRNA, a part of the cell called the ribosome translates and follows these instructions to build the encoded protein.</seg>
<seg id="10">The mRNA in these vaccines works in exactly the same way, but scientists use the molecule to safely introduce our body to a virus.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, researchers encode trillions of mRNA molecules with the instructions for a specific viral protein.</seg>
<seg id="12">This part of the virus is harmless by itself, but helpful for training our body’s immune response.</seg>
<seg id="13">Then, they inject those molecules into a nanoparticle roughly 1,000 times smaller than the average cell.</seg>
<seg id="14">This nanoparticle is made of lipids, the same type of fatty material that forms the membrane around our cells.</seg>
<seg id="15">But these lipids have been specially engineered to protect the mRNA on its journey through the body and assist its entry into the cell.</seg>
<seg id="16">Lastly, the final ingredients are added: sugars and salt to help keep the nanoparticles intact until they reach their destination.</seg>
<seg id="17">Before use, the vaccine is kept at a temperature of -20 to -80 degrees Celsius to ensure none of the components break down.</seg>
<seg id="18">Once injected, the nanoparticles disperse and encounter cells.</seg>
<seg id="19">The lipid coating on each nanoparticle fuses with the lipid membrane of a cell and releases the mRNA to do its work.</seg>
<seg id="20">At this point, we should note that while the vaccine is delivering viral genetic material into our cells, it’s impossible for this material to alter our DNA.</seg>
<seg id="21">mRNA is a short-lived molecule that would need additional enzymes and chemical signals to even access our DNA, let alone change it.</seg>
<seg id="22">And none of these DNA altering components are present in mRNA vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="23">Once inside the cell, the ribosome translates the mRNA’s instructions and begins assembling the viral protein.</seg>
<seg id="24">In COVID-19 vaccines, that protein is one of the spikes typically found on the virus’s surface.</seg>
<seg id="25">Without the rest of the virus this lone spike is not infectious, but it does trigger our immune response.</seg>
<seg id="26">Activating the immune system can be taxing on the body, resulting in brief fatigue, fever, and muscle soreness in some people.</seg>
<seg id="27">But this doesn’t mean the recipient is sick— it means the vaccine is working.</seg>
<seg id="28">The body is producing antibodies to fight that viral protein, that will then stick around to defend against future COVID-19 infections.</seg>
<seg id="29">And since this particular protein is likely to be found in most COVID variants, these antibodies should reduce the threat of catching new strains.</seg>
<seg id="30">This approach offers significant advantages over previous vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="31">Traditional vaccines contain weakened versions of live viruses or amputated sections of a virus, both of which required time intensive research to prepare and unique chemical treatments to safely inject.</seg>
<seg id="32">But mRNA vaccines don’t actually contain any viral particles, so they don’t have to be built from scratch to safely adjust each virus.</seg>
<seg id="33">In fact, every mRNA vaccine could have roughly the same list of ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="34">Imagine a reliable, robustly tested vaccine that can treat any disease by swapping out a single component.</seg>
<seg id="35">To treat a new illness, researchers would identify the right viral protein, encode it into mRNA, and then swap that mRNA into the existing vaccine platform.</seg>
<seg id="36">This could make it possible to develop new vaccines in weeks, giving humanity a flexible new tool in the never-ending fight against disease.</seg>

<seg id="1">For years, scientists have been staking out this remote forest in Montana for an animal that’s notoriously tricky to find.</seg>
<seg id="2">Camera traps haven’t offered definitive evidence, and even experts can't identify its tracks with certainty.</seg>
<seg id="3">But within the past decades, researchers have developed methods that can detect even the most elusive species.</seg>
<seg id="4">And so, in 2018, these scientists took a sample from some conspicuous snow tracks.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lab tests showed conclusive results: the Canada lynx was indeed present in the area.</seg>
<seg id="6">Without seeing the cat, scientists had proof it was there because of environmental DNA or eDNA.</seg>
<seg id="7">Using a technique called DNA metabarcoding, researchers can take a sample from the environment and learn which organisms are in it or have recently passed through it.</seg>
<seg id="8">The world is covered in DNA.</seg>
<seg id="9">It’s all around us— on the ground, at the bottom of the ocean, and up in the clouds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Multicellular organisms are constantly shedding cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">But until recently, eDNA wasn’t very useful to us.</seg>
<seg id="12">Traditional scientific techniques couldn’t parse environmental samples containing mixed genetic material from multiple species.</seg>
<seg id="13">But DNA metabarcoding can.</seg>
<seg id="14">DNA begins to degrade once it’s exposed to the environment.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the ocean, for example, it may only persist for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="16">So in many contexts, eDNA is useful for telling us about the recent past.</seg>
<seg id="17">The process of DNA metabarcoding starts with an environmental sample like a core of soil, a vial of water, some feces, an insect trap, or even the blood from leeches’ stomachs.</seg>
<seg id="18">Researchers then sift out everything aside from DNA by blending the sample up and using enzymes that break down cellular proteins and release DNA, which they purify.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is a “soup” of all the DNA in the sample.</seg>
<seg id="20">Scientists then apply the polymerase chain reaction or PCR, which uses artificial DNA strands called universal primers.</seg>
<seg id="21">These primers bind to DNA sequences that are similar across species, then amplify genetic barcodes that are species-specific.</seg>
<seg id="22">High-throughput sequencing then reads millions of these DNA fragments, simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="23">And finally, researchers compare them to reference databases and identify how many and which species are present— or if they’ve found entirely new ones.</seg>
<seg id="24">This method has led to the discovery of tens of thousands of species over the past decade.</seg>
<seg id="25">While metabarcoding can detect elusive animals like the Canada lynx, it can also help scientists identify invasive species.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Yosemite, researchers used eDNA to track and remove invasive bullfrogs.</seg>
<seg id="27">Once no trace of these amphibians remained, they reintroduced a threatened native species, California red-legged frogs, which had disappeared from the area some 50 years prior.</seg>
<seg id="28">Likewise, DNA metabarcoding can be used to monitor biodiversity.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, using traditional approaches, categorizing all of the insects in a hectare of rainforest can take decades.</seg>
<seg id="30">But DNA from insect traps could yield these results in just a few months.</seg>
<seg id="31">One study compared insects from adjacent forest and plantation sites within China’s Yunnan province.</seg>
<seg id="32">It quickly found that not only were plantations less diverse, but deforestation affected insect groups unequally.</seg>
<seg id="33">Grasshoppers thrived in cleared areas while specialist forest beetles declined.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using eDNA, scientists are able to investigate complex ecosystem interactions.</seg>
<seg id="35">Tracking thousands of insects as they visit flowers is impossible.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, researchers can study the DNA left on flowers and insects to map pollination networks.</seg>
<seg id="37">Before these techniques were available, we didn’t really know how much pollination was happening at night because we couldn’t observe it.</seg>
<seg id="38">Now scientists understand that moths are important nocturnal pollinators.</seg>
<seg id="39">eDNA can even tell stories of long extinct species.</seg>
<seg id="40">Cold, dry, and low oxygen conditions are perfect for preserving genetic material.</seg>
<seg id="41">By digging deep into the Arctic permafrost, researchers found 50,000 year old DNA, which they matched to the nutrient-rich plants found in the stomachs of woolly mammoths.</seg>
<seg id="42">With eDNA, they also found that less nutritious grasses colonized the Arctic steppe during the last ice age, potentially contributing to the mammoth decline.</seg>
<seg id="43">As we face another period of climate change— this time due to human activities— understanding our planet’s rapidly shifting biodiversity will be crucial to protecting it.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fortunately, eDNA and metabarcoding give us the tools to document rapid change in real time.</seg>

<seg id="1">In 1776, a powerful empire was born in North America.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Lakotas had reached the Black Hills, the most sacred place and most coveted buffalo hunting grounds in the western plains.</seg>
<seg id="3">Located in what is now South Dakota, control of the Black Hills, or Paha Sapa, marked the Lakotas as the dominant power in the American West.</seg>
<seg id="4">Just a few decades before, they were vying for power in the eastern woodlands— and losing.</seg>
<seg id="5">One of seven nations, or seven council fires, that made up the Sioux Alliance, the Lakotas had lived in the forests and wetlands between the Great Lakes and the Missouri Valley for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the 1600s, European colonizers destabilized this region.</seg>
<seg id="7">While some tribes profited by trading furs with new France, the Lakotas lived just out of range of the best trade opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="8">So in the early 1700s, they turned their attention west.</seg>
<seg id="9">The western plains were much less fertile and abundant than the Lakotas’ homelands.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only easy access to food and water was immediately alongside the rivers— land Arikaras had already claimed.</seg>
<seg id="11">To compete, the Lakotas became skilled buffalo hunters and warriors on horseback.</seg>
<seg id="12">They conquered the farming Arikaras, forcing them to pay tributes of maize and squash.</seg>
<seg id="13">When the Spanish arrived expecting to find lucrative trading grounds, they had to pay tolls to the Lakotas instead.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 1804, a new spectacle came floating up the Missouri River: Merriwether Lewis and William Clark.</seg>
<seg id="15">Lakota chief Black Buffalo refused to let them pass until they paid a hefty tribute.</seg>
<seg id="16">In spite of this rocky start, the expedition marked the beginning of a close trade alliance between the Lakotas and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lakota men hunted buffalo, while women processed the hides into robes for trade.</seg>
<seg id="18">The US government supplied guns, ammunition, and other goods, even providing Lakotas with smallpox vaccines that protected them from the deadly epidemics that ravaged other Native American nations.</seg>
<seg id="19">On paper, the United States had acquired the Lakotas’ lands from France in the Louisiana Purchase.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the Lakotas would not cede their lands because of an agreement between two foreign powers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Though there were 15,000 Lakotas and 23 million Americans, the bulk of US population and military might was concentrated on the east coast.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just getting an army to Lakota territory presented a huge expense, and once there they would face formidable warriors with deep local knowledge and alliances.</seg>
<seg id="23">To avoid a war it couldn’t afford and wouldn’t win, the US government attempted to appease the Lakotas, paying steep tributes of ammunition and rations demanded by Lakota leaders.</seg>
<seg id="24">So while almost all the Native Americans in North America were being forced off their lands and onto reservations, the Lakota Empire was still expanding.</seg>
<seg id="25">By 1850, they controlled some 500,000 square kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="26">They were spread thinly across this vast area, moving their villages in pursuit of Buffalo.</seg>
<seg id="27">Though there was no central authority, the leaders of bands, or oyates, came together at annual Sun Dances to strategize and coordinate complex diplomatic operations.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lasting a few weeks each summer, Sun Dances were spiritual ceremonies that reaffirmed communal ties, appeased Wakan Tanka, the Great Spirit, and kept the world in balance.</seg>
<seg id="29">Starting in 1849, the California gold rush brought hordes of white settlers west, encroaching on Lakota territory and disturbing the buffalo herds.</seg>
<seg id="30">Lakota leaders correctly interpreted this migration as a signal that the US no longer intended to respect their claim to the land.</seg>
<seg id="31">In retaliation, they attacked wagon trains and government offices.</seg>
<seg id="32">As the conflict grew, Chief Red Cloud negotiated in Washington DC.</seg>
<seg id="33">While back in Lakota territory, chiefs Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and others prepared for battle.</seg>
<seg id="34">They mobilized their Cheyenne and Arapaho allies and almost all the other Sioux nations against the US.</seg>
<seg id="35">In 1876, exactly 100 years after the Lakotas’ arrival, gold prospectors occupied the sacred Black Hills.</seg>
<seg id="36">For many Lakotas, this was the final straw.</seg>
<seg id="37">Following a vision by Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse led Lakota forces to decisively defeat the Americans in the Battle of the Little Bighorn.</seg>
<seg id="38">After this victory, the Lakotas faced an even graver threat: wagon travel and railroad construction had decimated buffalo populations, and they faced starvation.</seg>
<seg id="39">To survive, they moved on to reservations, where the authorities murdered Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse and attempted to dismantle their culture, prohibiting the Sun Dance on reservations.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Lakotas started a protest movement called the Ghost Dance.</seg>
<seg id="41">Alarmed by this resistance, in 1890, the US Army massacred hundreds of Lakotas, many of them women and children, at Wounded Knee Creek.</seg>
<seg id="42">Today, Lakotas continue to fight for their culture and their land.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2016, they drew supporters worldwide to protest construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline through their reservation, continuing a long history of resistance to a government known for breaking its promises.</seg>

<seg id="1">The distinct forms of speech heard around Bremen, Germany and Interlaken, Switzerland are considered regional dialects of the German language.</seg>
<seg id="2">And yet, when someone from Bremen is visiting the Swiss Alps, the conversations they hear between locals will likely be incomprehensible to them.</seg>
<seg id="3">Similarly, outside of China, Mandarin and Cantonese are often referred to as Chinese dialects.</seg>
<seg id="4">But they’re even more dissimilar than Spanish and Italian.</seg>
<seg id="5">On the other hand, speakers of Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, which are recognized as three distinct languages, can usually communicate in their native tongues with little difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="6">And Turkish language soap operas, broadcast without dubbing or subtitles, are some of the most popular shows in Azeri-speaking Azerbaijan.</seg>
<seg id="7">So, when is a form of speech considered a dialect versus a language?</seg>
<seg id="8">It seems reasonable that the degree of mutual intelligibility would determine whether two ways of speaking are classified as separate languages or as dialects of the same language.</seg>
<seg id="9">But as we've seen, there are many occasions where this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="10">Perhaps surprisingly, the distinction between a language and a dialect usually has nothing to do with pronunciation, vocabulary, or any other linguistic features.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, it’s not coincidental, either.</seg>
<seg id="12">It’s a matter of politics.</seg>
<seg id="13">The basis for what’s officially deemed a language was shaped by the emergence of a European nation states beginning around the 1500s.</seg>
<seg id="14">In order to establish and maintain centralized governments, clear territorial boundaries, and state-sponsored education systems, many nation states promoted a standardized language.</seg>
<seg id="15">Which form of speech was chosen to be the standard language was usually based on what people spoke in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="16">And while other forms of speech persisted, they were often treated as inferior.</seg>
<seg id="17">This tradition extended across the globe with European colonization and into modern times.</seg>
<seg id="18">Italy, for example, has at least 15 of what might be called regional dialects.</seg>
<seg id="19">One of them, the Florentine dialect, became known as Standard Italian when the country politically unified in 1861.</seg>
<seg id="20">It was selected because legendary authors like Dante and Machiavelli used it in their original works, And it came to represent an image of Italian national identity that some found particularly desirable.</seg>
<seg id="21">Later on, in his attempt to establish a unified, fascist state, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini saw language standardization as an important objective.</seg>
<seg id="22">His government promoted standard Italian while prohibiting other forms of speech from the public sphere, framing them as backward and unsophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="23">In everything from job applications to court testimonies, standard languages act as gatekeepers around the world.</seg>
<seg id="24">For instance, one 1999 study showed that landlords responded to apartment inquiries based on what form of speech their prospective tenants used.</seg>
<seg id="25">When callers spoke African-American Vernacular English, or AAVE, landlords were more likely to reject their inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="26">When they spoke so-called Standard American English, which is often associated with whiteness, landlords responded more positively.</seg>
<seg id="27">Both of these forms of speech are considered English dialects.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the United States, some people have cast AAVE as an incorrect or simplified version of mainstream US English.</seg>
<seg id="29">But AAVE follows consistent grammatical rules every bit as sophisticated as other forms of English.</seg>
<seg id="30">Linguists tend to avoid the term dialect altogether.</seg>
<seg id="31">Instead, many opt to call different forms of speech “varieties.” This way, languages are seen as groups of varieties.</seg>
<seg id="32">So the English language is made up of varieties including Standard British and American English, AAVE, Nigerian English, Malaysian English, and many others.</seg>
<seg id="33">Each has its own unique history and characteristic pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammatical structures.</seg>
<seg id="34">But the dividing line between varieties is murky.</seg>
<seg id="35">Human language, in all its cross-pollinating, ever-evolving glory, naturally resists the impulse to sort it into neat buckets.</seg>
<seg id="36">Oftentimes, forms of speech exist on a kind of linguistic continuum where they overlap with others, and the differences between them are gradual— not clear cut.</seg>
<seg id="37">And that’s the confounding beauty of the dynamic, diverse, and dazzling universe of human communication.</seg>

<seg id="1">You are the captain of the Mallory 7, an interstellar cargo transport.</seg>
<seg id="2">On your way to the New Lindley spaceport, you receive a distress call.</seg>
<seg id="3">There’s been an explosion on the Telic 12 and its passengers are running out of oxygen.</seg>
<seg id="4">As you set a course to intercept, you check the Telic 12′s manifest.</seg>
<seg id="5">It’s currently transporting 30 middle-aged individuals from some of Earth’s poorest districts to the labor center on New Lindley, where they'll be assigned jobs on the spaceport.</seg>
<seg id="6">But as you approach the Telic 12, you receive a second distress call.</seg>
<seg id="7">A luxury space cruiser called the Pareto has lost a thruster, sending them careening towards an asteroid belt.</seg>
<seg id="8">Without your help, the 20 college students headed for vacation aboard the Pareto are all doomed.</seg>
<seg id="9">So with only enough time to save one ship, which one should you choose?</seg>
<seg id="10">This dilemma is an example of a broader class of problems where a life-saving resource— such as a donated organ or vaccine— is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are many schools of thought on how to approach these problems, and one of the most influential is utilitarianism, an ethical view first systematically developed by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this view, you should choose the action which promises the greatest sum of happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">Though, how to define and measure happiness is a difficult question.</seg>
<seg id="14">For example, hedonists would suggest a happy life contains the most pleasure and the least pain.</seg>
<seg id="15">Others might say it’s the life where your desires are most fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="16">However happiness is defined, most would agree that saving 30 lives has the potential to generate more happiness than saving 20.</seg>
<seg id="17">But is it enough to consider how many lives would be saved?</seg>
<seg id="18">Or should you also consider how many life years would be?</seg>
<seg id="19">Assuming a life expectancy of 80, saving the lives of the students, with an average age of 20, saves 1,200 life years, while saving the workers, with an average age of 45, saves 1,050.</seg>
<seg id="20">All things being equal, a longer life should promise a greater sum of happiness than a shorter one.</seg>
<seg id="21">So perhaps saving the smaller ship actually has the potential to generate the most happiness.</seg>
<seg id="22">If all these calculations feel a bit cold, you may want to consider a different approach.</seg>
<seg id="23">The philosopher Derek Parfit argues we should give priority to the worse off, since benefits to those groups matter more than equivalent benefits to the well-off.</seg>
<seg id="24">In this view, it’s more urgent to help those whose basic needs aren’t met even if they’re harder to help than those who are flourishing.</seg>
<seg id="25">But often, determining which group is truly worse off can get complicated fast.</seg>
<seg id="26">In our case, Earth is still beset by drastic inequalities in wealth and opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="27">And those able to afford a vacation on New Lindley and transport on a luxury cruiser are no doubt among the most well-off people on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">The workers, by contrast, are among the most disadvantaged, traveling away from home for months at a time to perform service work.</seg>
<seg id="29">With fewer resources and opportunities, it’s likely they’ve experienced more hardship in their lives than the vacationers, so maybe they’re more deserving of rescue?</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand, the students have experienced less life overall— so perhaps they’re worse off?</seg>
<seg id="31">Or maybe none of these variables should influence our decision.</seg>
<seg id="32">The philosopher John Taurek famously argued that in these types of cases, the numbers don’t count.</seg>
<seg id="33">Each person is deserving of equal concern and respect, so the best way to decide which passengers to save is to flip a coin.</seg>
<seg id="34">While this might seem arbitrary at first, this approach treats all parties equally, giving each individual an equal chance of being rescued.</seg>
<seg id="35">Could any passenger argue that they're being treated unfairly by a coin flip?</seg>
<seg id="36">It’s tough to say.</seg>
<seg id="37">But how they— and you— feel about the result may be another dilemma altogether.</seg>

<seg id="1">I wake up in a hospital bed and I'm surrounded by doctors.</seg>
<seg id="2">Everything is hazy.</seg>
<seg id="3">I've been in and out of consciousness for over a week.</seg>
<seg id="4">The doctors are telling me that I have a bad infection in my leg.</seg>
<seg id="5">They say that they've operated eight times already.</seg>
<seg id="6">They say that at one point my fever spiked and my immune system started attacking my body.</seg>
<seg id="7">I went septic and almost died.</seg>
<seg id="8">And then one of the doctors says this: "As we speak, flesh-eating bacteria is crawling up your leg. It's getting closer to your vital organs every minute."</seg>
<seg id="9">Good morning to you, too, doctor.</seg>
<seg id="10">Let me back up.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm a professional football player.</seg>
<seg id="12">I played quarterback.</seg>
<seg id="13">And two weeks earlier, two defenders, almost 500 pounds of muscle, crushed me at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="14">It sounds scary, but honestly, it's pretty normal in my line of work.</seg>
<seg id="15">This time, though, my leg was bending where it shouldn't.</seg>
<seg id="16">I had what they call a compound spiral fracture, which means that my leg was twisted and snapped diagonally, kind of like a corkscrew.</seg>
<seg id="17">And yes, it's as painful as it sounds.</seg>
<seg id="18">I knew right there on the field that my season was done.</seg>
<seg id="19">What took me a little longer to figure out was that my life was about to change forever.</seg>
<seg id="20">Two years after that gruesome injury, I actually ran back out onto that field and led my team to the playoffs.</seg>
<seg id="21">But what I want to talk about today isn't some rousing comeback story where the crowd chants my name.</seg>
<seg id="22">I want to talk about the stuff that happens out of you.</seg>
<seg id="23">The stuff that athletes like me don't want to discuss because we think it makes us look weak.</seg>
<seg id="24">I want to talk about fear, anxiety and self-doubt.</seg>
<seg id="25">Because if I wanted to really fully recover from my injury, I didn't just need to learn to walk and run again.</seg>
<seg id="26">I also needed something to run towards, something to live for.</seg>
<seg id="27">After that first hazy conversation, in order to save my leg, the doctors actually removed part of my good thigh and reattached it to my busted-up leg.</seg>
<seg id="28">Now, they didn't know if the muscle would take, so after the surgery, every hour, the doctors and nurses would come in, unwrap the wound, apply a gel and search for a heartbeat in the muscle.</seg>
<seg id="29">Every time I would make them put up this big white sheet to block my vision, because from what I could tell, it wasn't a pretty sight.</seg>
<seg id="30">My leg was essentially a giant open wound.</seg>
<seg id="31">When the doctors and nurses were back there, my wife would be back there with them trying to cheer me up.</seg>
<seg id="32">"It looks so good."</seg>
<seg id="33">"Babe, it's so cool."</seg>
<seg id="34">There was no way she was going to get me to look down there.</seg>
<seg id="35">The truth is, I couldn't bear to.</seg>
<seg id="36">Not because I couldn't stomach it, but because I couldn't accept what had happened to me.</seg>
<seg id="37">This went on for months.</seg>
<seg id="38">At the time I was wheelchair-bound, at home, my wife had to be there for me every second of the day, even helping me to go to the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="39">I spent most of my days sitting propped up on the couch just thinking, was I ever going to walk again?</seg>
<seg id="40">Play catch with my kids again?</seg>
<seg id="41">Wrestle with them on the living room floor?</seg>
<seg id="42">All this for a stupid, meaningless game?</seg>
<seg id="43">To that point, my life had been so big, so full of possibility, but now it all seemed to be spiraling down, like that fracture in my leg.</seg>
<seg id="44">And I'll be honest, this wasn't the first time that my mind had been twisted up like that.</seg>
<seg id="45">Let me tell you how my career started.</seg>
<seg id="46">I was this nothing college recruit.</seg>
<seg id="47">But in my last two years at school, I played pretty well and somehow catapulted up to be the first pick in the NFL draft.</seg>
<seg id="48">Over the course of a couple of months, I went from a guy most people hadn't even heard of to the next great quarterback to the San Francisco 49ers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Joe Montana, Steve Young, me.</seg>
<seg id="50">I was a 20-year-old kid at the time, and I didn't handle that pressure well.</seg>
<seg id="51">I got really, really anxious.</seg>
<seg id="52">Do I really belong here?</seg>
<seg id="53">How long until they find out I'm a fraud?</seg>
<seg id="54">The questions paralyzed me.</seg>
<seg id="55">I was absolutely terrified to make mistakes, and I was desperate for others' validation.</seg>
<seg id="56">It followed me around 24/7.</seg>
<seg id="57">I got to where I couldn't eat before games, I constantly felt nauseous.</seg>
<seg id="58">I'd be at the dinner table with my wife or some friends, and I just ...</seg>
<seg id="59">I wasn't there.</seg>
<seg id="60">To the outside world, I was playing this game I loved.</seg>
<seg id="61">I'd achieved what millions of kids grow up dreaming about.</seg>
<seg id="62">But in my mind, I was sinking like a stone.</seg>
<seg id="63">It stayed that way for the better part of five years.</seg>
<seg id="64">I'd have some success, but then I'd get injured or get a new coach.</seg>
<seg id="65">And the cycle would start over again.</seg>
<seg id="66">And then I got two key pieces of advice.</seg>
<seg id="67">The first came in the form of a guy named Jim Harbaugh.</seg>
<seg id="68">He was my coach at the time.</seg>
<seg id="69">Now, what's best about coach Harbaugh is he simply does not care what other people think about him.</seg>
<seg id="70">He couldn't be more comfortable in his pleated khakis and tucked-in sweatshirt.</seg>
<seg id="71">Now, coach Harbaugh used to tell the team the same thing right before we would take the field on game day.</seg>
<seg id="72">He would say, "Play as hard as you can, as fast as you can, for as long as you can. And don't worry."</seg>
<seg id="73">"Don't worry."</seg>
<seg id="74">It sounds simple, and it is, but I guess I didn't really believe it was possible until it came from somebody that I trusted.</seg>
<seg id="75">Around the same time, I had a teammate named Blake Costanzo.</seg>
<seg id="76">Blake was a linebacker who was a little nuts.</seg>
<seg id="77">Before games, he would run around the locker room and he would get in everybody's face and he'd ask, "Are you going to live today? I'm going to live today, are you?"</seg>
<seg id="78">At first, I didn't get it.</seg>
<seg id="79">But then he started to win me over.</seg>
<seg id="80">He was a guy who approached the game in the exact opposite way that I did.</seg>
<seg id="81">He was taking the challenge head on.</seg>
<seg id="82">He was fully present, right in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="83">Right in my face, just live.</seg>
<seg id="84">These ideas were a counterweight to all my doubts.</seg>
<seg id="85">And wouldn't you know it?</seg>
<seg id="86">I started playing better.</seg>
<seg id="87">Started having fun again, and we started winning.</seg>
<seg id="88">For the rest of my career, I would talk to a small group of teammates before games and tell them some form of the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="89">Just live.</seg>
<seg id="90">And even as I got traded twice and replaced by a couple of great young quarterbacks, I stuck with that ethic.</seg>
<seg id="91">But when my leg got infected, I completely lost that perspective.</seg>
<seg id="92">You might as well have taken that white sheet I was hiding behind and draped it over my face because I wasn't really living.</seg>
<seg id="93">And once again, I needed somebody to help me snap out of it.</seg>
<seg id="94">That spring, I started rehabbing at a military facility called the Center for the Intrepid.</seg>
<seg id="95">Because while my injury was unheard of for a football player, it was eerily similar to that of our wounded warriors.</seg>
<seg id="96">Basically, my leg exploded like I stepped on an IED.</seg>
<seg id="97">Before I got down there, I'd watched hours and hours of videos of these double and triple amputees and a lot of guys with injuries like mine who were going on to the Paralympics or rejoining the Army Rangers or the Navy SEALs.</seg>
<seg id="98">I was in awe of them.</seg>
<seg id="99">I wanted to be like them.</seg>
<seg id="100">But one of my PTs, Johnny Owens, made sure I knew right away it wasn't going to be easy to get back on my feet.</seg>
<seg id="101">Literally.</seg>
<seg id="102">The first day I was down there, I was doing a balance exercise on my good leg and he just shoved me right in the chest.</seg>
<seg id="103">"Come on, Alex."</seg>
<seg id="104">Then he shoved me again.</seg>
<seg id="105">"Come on, you can do better than that."</seg>
<seg id="106">Then he did something that changed my recovery completely.</seg>
<seg id="107">He handed me a football.</seg>
<seg id="108">You see, after spending years and years of my life with a football in my hands, I hadn't touched one for months since my injury.</seg>
<seg id="109">It was like reattaching a lost limb.</seg>
<seg id="110">He told me to throw from one knee.</seg>
<seg id="111">I zipped one to him.</seg>
<seg id="112">A better kind of spiral.</seg>
<seg id="113">From that point on, if you put a ball in my hands, I felt stronger.</seg>
<seg id="114">I did my exercises better.</seg>
<seg id="115">I can't explain it, but I felt lighter.</seg>
<seg id="116">I felt alive.</seg>
<seg id="117">After that first visit, I felt like I had permission to dream again.</seg>
<seg id="118">I thought about getting back out onto the field.</seg>
<seg id="119">If I make it back, great, if I don't, who cares, at least I was living for something.</seg>
<seg id="120">And that's the mentality that carried me through my recovery.</seg>
<seg id="121">Through numerous setbacks, both physically and mentally, I eventually got cleared by the doctors.</seg>
<seg id="122">I actually made the roster.</seg>
<seg id="123">And then, 693 days after my injury, I got the call to put on my helmet and take my first snap in a game.</seg>
<seg id="124">Now, I wish I could tell you that the crowd went wild, but there was basically nobody there because of COVID.</seg>
<seg id="125">And still, running onto that field, I had so many mixed emotions.</seg>
<seg id="126">What a rush.</seg>
<seg id="127">But to be honest, I was absolutely terrified.</seg>
<seg id="128">Practice was one thing, but a real game?</seg>
<seg id="129">Was my leg going to hold up?</seg>
<seg id="130">I found out on the third snap when this huge defender launched himself onto my back, I tried to take a few steps, but I went down.</seg>
<seg id="131">It's still the most liberating feeling in my life, getting back up, knowing that I'm OK.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm proud that I made it back out onto the field, but I'm more proud of what got me there.</seg>
<seg id="133">Not the physical journey, but the mental one.</seg>
<seg id="134">I've learned that so much of the anxiety that holds us back in life, it's self-inflicted.</seg>
<seg id="135">We make it worse on ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="136">And it's OK if we need somebody to help us snap out of it.</seg>
<seg id="137">For me, that was my wife, a military guy, a maniac linebacker or an eccentric coach.</seg>
<seg id="138">They taught me that I had to see my fears for what they are.</seg>
<seg id="139">And that's why, looking back, I know that my recovery didn't actually start when Johnny shoved me in the chest.</seg>
<seg id="140">First, I had to pull back that white sheet.</seg>
<seg id="141">For weeks and weeks, I'd been hearing my wife tell me how great it looked.</seg>
<seg id="142">She helped me get to that point.</seg>
<seg id="143">I was ready.</seg>
<seg id="144">And when I finally did it, it looked way worse than I had expected.</seg>
<seg id="145">What I saw was not cool.</seg>
<seg id="146">It was grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="147">Mangled and deformed.</seg>
<seg id="148">All kinds of purple and blue and red.</seg>
<seg id="149">Fair warning, these pictures are a little graphic.</seg>
<seg id="150">But my leg went from this, the black is the dead tissue, to this.</seg>
<seg id="151">And this.</seg>
<seg id="152">Before it could get rebuilt.</seg>
<seg id="153">But I saw my leg for what it was.</seg>
<seg id="154">And it was mine.</seg>
<seg id="155">These days, I've come a long way with this guy.</seg>
<seg id="156">This thing that once represented everything I feared, everything I had lost, it's probably the thing I'm most proud of in my life outside of my wife and kids.</seg>
<seg id="157">So, yeah, I guess she was right, it is pretty cool.</seg>
<seg id="158">These scars, they're not just a reminder of everything I've been through, but more so, everything that's in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="159">They stare me in my face.</seg>
<seg id="160">Challenging me to be myself.</seg>
<seg id="161">To help others out of their own spirals when I can.</seg>
<seg id="162">Now, you might not have a leg that looks like this.</seg>
<seg id="163">But I’ll bet you’ve got some scars.</seg>
<seg id="164">And my hope for you is this.</seg>
<seg id="165">Look at them.</seg>
<seg id="166">Own them.</seg>
<seg id="167">They're the best reminder you'll ever have that there's a whole world out there.</seg>
<seg id="168">And we've got a whole lot of living left to do.</seg>
<seg id="169">Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="1">Transcriber: How long does it take to get over a breakup?</seg>
<seg id="2">The good news is I've done the research for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">The bad news is that you might not like the answer.</seg>
<seg id="4">[Am I Normal? with Mona Chalabi] See, a few years back, a number of publications were touting a study telling their readers that it takes 11 weeks to get over a breakup.</seg>
<seg id="5">That's nearly three months spent listening to depressing music while putting on a brave face.</seg>
<seg id="6">It might feel longer than it is, but it's only a few swipes on the calendar app.</seg>
<seg id="7">No big deal, right?</seg>
<seg id="8">Well, unfortunately, it's not so straightforward.</seg>
<seg id="9">See, those articles drastically misrepresented that study.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, the study never said anything about how long it takes to get over a breakup.</seg>
<seg id="11">It only focused on the aftereffects of ending a relationship, specifically among undergrads, which is a whole other can of worms.</seg>
<seg id="12">To really answer that question of how long it takes to get over a breakup, you would need to do a longitudinal study, a study that would basically follow a ton of people from the moment of their breakup and track their progress year after year after year.</seg>
<seg id="13">But studies like that are expensive and complicated to carry out.</seg>
<seg id="14">So with no adequate data, I decided to seek professional help.</seg>
<seg id="15">I went to couples therapists, Dr. Hod Tamir.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has anecdotal experience with countless people in relationships and, full disclosure, he was my couple’s therapist, too.</seg>
<seg id="17">So I asked him how long he thinks it takes to get over a breakup.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I don't think there is a magic number ... If we feel like we can express ourselves in how we're feeling, we don't have to keep it bottled up. Once you're doing other things that you're engaged with and distracted by, then at some point you look back and like, 'Oh yeah, that's my ex.' And you notice that the feelings that you have are not as raw. You can bump into each other and not feel pain."</seg>
<seg id="19">And the data supports Dr. Tamir's theory.</seg>
<seg id="20">One study looked at different strategies for love regulation.</seg>
<seg id="21">In other words, can a few simple methods change how much you love someone?</seg>
<seg id="22">The study found that when participants were distracted into thinking about something other than their ex, like, their favorite hobby or ideal career, their love feelings for their ex stayed the same, but it did make them feel more pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="23">Using distractions to start to feel better is exactly what Dr. Tamir has suggested.</seg>
<seg id="24">The study also found that a negative reappraisal strategy, essentially remembering all of the shit things your ex said and did, does decrease love feelings for your ex.</seg>
<seg id="25">But it also makes you feel "unpleasant," and I'm guessing that means sad.</seg>
<seg id="26">Finally, a third, more zen strategy known as reappraisal of love feelings.</seg>
<seg id="27">For this, participants had to muse over statements like "Love is part of life" and "It's OK to love someone I'm no longer with."</seg>
<seg id="28">Yeah, that changed nothing at all for them.</seg>
<seg id="29">Overall, the researchers concluded, and I'm not using the scientific language here, that concentrating on the bad things about your ex can help you to feel less in love.</seg>
<seg id="30">While distracting yourself with other subjects, as my therapist suggested, can actually make you feel better.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, the research and Dr. Tamir would both tell you that while distraction is good in the short term, it is not a long-term solution.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Taking that time to process and understand it is actually a much quicker way to heal than ignoring it."</seg>
<seg id="33">Eventually, for the sake of ourselves and our future partners, we're going to have to face up to our feelings.</seg>
<seg id="34">So how long does it take to get over a breakup?</seg>
<seg id="35">Well, we don't have enough long-term studies to know.</seg>
<seg id="36">But more importantly, I’ve learned that instead of counting down the days, we're much better off reconnecting with the things we love to do.</seg>
<seg id="37">Finding something to distract us and unpacking our feelings when we're ready.</seg>
<seg id="38">If we can do all that, then one day hopefully we'll come out of it feeling OK.</seg>
<seg id="39">And in the end, isn't that what we're really after?</seg>

<seg id="1">Inside our cells, each of us has a second set of genes completely separate from the 23 pairs of chromosomes we inherit from our parents.</seg>
<seg id="2">And this isn’t just the case for humans— it’s true of every animal, plant, and fungus, and nearly every multicellular organism on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="3">This second genome belongs to our mitochondria, an organelle inside our cells.</seg>
<seg id="4">They’re not fully a part of us, but they’re not separate either— so why are they so different from anything else in our bodies?</seg>
<seg id="5">Approximately 1.5 billion years ago, scientists think a single-celled organism engulfed the mitochondria’s ancestor, creating the predecessor of all multicellular organisms.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mitochondria play an essential role: they convert energy from the food we eat and oxygen we breathe into a form of energy our cells can use, which is a molecule called ATP.</seg>
<seg id="7">Without this energy, our cells start to die.</seg>
<seg id="8">Humans have over 200 types of cells, and all except mature red blood cells have mitochondria.</seg>
<seg id="9">That’s because a red blood cell’s job is to transport oxygen, which mitochondria would use up before it could reach its destination.</seg>
<seg id="10">So all mitochondria use oxygen and metabolites to create energy and have their own DNA, but mitochondrial DNA varies more across species than other DNA.</seg>
<seg id="11">In mammals, mitochondria usually have 37 genes.</seg>
<seg id="12">In some plants, like cucumbers, mitochondria have up to 65 genes, and some fungal mitochondria have only 1.</seg>
<seg id="13">A few microbes that live in oxygen-poor environments seem to be on the way to losing their mitochondria entirely, and one group, oxymonad monocercomonoides, already has.</seg>
<seg id="14">This variety exists because mitochondria are still evolving, both in tandem with the organisms that contain them, and separately, on their own timeline.</seg>
<seg id="15">To understand how that’s possible, it helps to take a closer look at what the mitochondria inside us are doing, starting from the moment we’re conceived.</seg>
<seg id="16">In almost all species, mitochondrial DNA is passed down from only one parent.</seg>
<seg id="17">In humans and most animals, that parent is the mother.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sperm contain approximately 50 to 75 mitochondria in the tail, to help them swim.</seg>
<seg id="19">These dissolve with the tail after conception.</seg>
<seg id="20">Meanwhile, an egg contains thousands of mitochondria, each containing multiple copies of the mitochondrial DNA.</seg>
<seg id="21">This translates to over 150,000 copies of mitochondrial DNA that we inherit from our mothers, each of which is independent and could vary slightly from the others.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a fertilized egg grows and divides, those thousands of mitochondria are divvied up into the cells of the developing embryo.</seg>
<seg id="23">By the time we have differentiated tissues and organs, variations in the mitochondrial DNA are scattered at random throughout our bodies.</seg>
<seg id="24">To make matters even more complex, mitochondria have a separate replication process from our cells.</seg>
<seg id="25">So as our cells replicate by dividing, mitochondria end up in new cells, and all the while they’re fusing and dividing themselves, on their own timeline.</seg>
<seg id="26">As mitochondria combine and separate, they sequester faulty DNA or mitochondria that aren’t working properly for removal.</seg>
<seg id="27">All this means that the random selection of your mother’s mitochondrial DNA you inherit at birth can change throughout your life and throughout your body.</seg>
<seg id="28">So mitochondria are dynamic and, to a degree, independent, but they’re also shaped by their environments: us.</seg>
<seg id="29">We think that long ago, some of their genes were transferred to their host’s genomes.</seg>
<seg id="30">So today, although mitochondria have their own genome and replicate separately from the cells that contain them, they can't do this without instruction from our DNA.</seg>
<seg id="31">And though mitochondrial DNA is inherited from one parent, the genes involved in building and regulating the mitochondria come from both.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mitochondria continue to defy tidy classification.</seg>
<seg id="33">Their story is still unfolding inside of each of our cells, simultaneously separate and inseparable from our own.</seg>
<seg id="34">Learning more about them can both give us tools to protect human health in the future, and teach us more about our history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Along the Nile River, in what is now northern Sudan, lay the ancient civilization of Kush.</seg>
<seg id="2">Though they were once conquered by a powerful neighbor, the kings and queens of Kush would go on to successfully challenge two of the most dominant empires in history.</seg>
<seg id="3">From 1500 to 1100 BCE, Egypt controlled Kush, introducing many Egyptian cultural and religious practices.</seg>
<seg id="4">The civilization of Kush was more than a thousand years old at that time.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its early capital city at Kerma had impressive temples, palaces, and houses, including a massive mudbrick temple structure that had a chapel deep inside, reached by a long staircase at the center.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rich gold mines helped the Kushites build a flourishing commercial network, making bronze weapons and tools and trading materials like incense, animal skins, ivory, and ebony wood from sub-Saharan Africa.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tide started to change for Kush as Egypt descended into civil war.</seg>
<seg id="8">By 750 BCE, Egypt was divided into local kingdoms with fluctuating alliances.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Kushite king Piankhy saw an opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="10">He led his navy, flanked by horsemen and archers, up the Nile to the gateway city of Khemenu.</seg>
<seg id="11">As Piankhy’s army constructed siege ramps and battle towers, the city’s ruler sent his wives and daughters to negotiate— not with Piankhy, but with the women of his royal household, later known as kandake, who were extremely influential in military affairs and political succession.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the end of a long siege, Piankhy entered the conquered city and bitterly criticized the conditions in its stables.</seg>
<seg id="13">From there, Piankhy and the Kushite forces conquered the Egyptian capital of Memphis.</seg>
<seg id="14">Piankhy installed his sister, Amunirdis, as priestess of the great god Amun, in the Egyptian city of Thebes, and left other Kushite officials there before returning to live in Kush.</seg>
<seg id="15">His successors extended control all the way to the Nile Delta.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was a high point for the Empire of Kush: trade thrived, and they built magnificent temples, palaces, and pyramid tombs all along the Nile.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the Assyrian army was approaching Egypt in its annual campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="18">When the Assyrians began to encroach on trade routes near Jerusalem, the Kushite king Taharqo moved to stop them.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Assyrians defeated him with the help of some rebelling Egyptian princes, and drove him out of Egypt in the 7th century BCE.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Kushites continued to rule in their homeland for nearly 1,000 years that were prosperous and innovative.</seg>
<seg id="21">They moved their capital farther south to the city of Meroe, where they built temples to a new god called Apedemak.</seg>
<seg id="22">They built new cities in the savannah south of the Sahara Desert, some of which contained huge reservoirs for water.</seg>
<seg id="23">When the Roman Empire conquered Egypt in 31 BCE, Kushite armies again traveled north, led by Queen Amanirenas.</seg>
<seg id="24">She led them to success in battle against the Romans, capturing the bronze head of a statue of the Roman emperor Augustus, and bringing it back to Kush.</seg>
<seg id="25">They buried it under the doorway of a temple in the capital, so that worshippers would step on it as they crossed the threshold.</seg>
<seg id="26">After brokering peace with the Romans, Kush continued to prosper.</seg>
<seg id="27">Over time, however, groups of people called the Noba raided from the west, and trade routes were disrupted by the rising kingdom of Aksum.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 350 CE, the Aksumite king sacked Meroe, effectively bringing Kushite rule to an end.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since then, some have argued that Kush’s history has been overlooked by generations of European and American scholars who promoted the idea that Egypt was part of the origin of Western civilization, while Kush, as an African culture, was excluded.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there’s still much to learn about Kush— including a writing system we haven’t deciphered fully.</seg>

<seg id="1">It's midnight on September 16th, 2017, 60 kilometers off the Bulgarian coast and 2 kilometers beneath the Black Sea’s surface.</seg>
<seg id="2">A remotely operated vehicle surveys the seabed, transmitting video to researchers above as it goes.</seg>
<seg id="3">Suddenly, it discerns another ghostly vessel in the gloom.</seg>
<seg id="4">But this is a relic from another age.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's an undoubtedly ancient shipwreck, but its mast, rowing benches, and some of its upper deck remain eerily intact.</seg>
<seg id="6">It might be an ancient Roman ship, but its appearance doesn’t quite match.</seg>
<seg id="7">Notably, its splayed rudder blade more closely resembles those depicted on an even older Greek vase.</seg>
<seg id="8">To get a definitive answer, the research team takes three samples from the wreck and radiocarbon dating confirms its ancient origins.</seg>
<seg id="9">The ship is dated to between 350 and 410 BCE.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is, in fact, the oldest intact shipwreck ever found.</seg>
<seg id="11">This ancient Greek vessel traversed the Black Sea’s coasts during the time of Aristotle and has since rested in its depths, unseen and undisturbed, for almost 2,500 years.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was just one of 65 shipwrecks a research team discovered at the bottom of the Black Sea between 2015 and 2017.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others date from the Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman empires.</seg>
<seg id="14">And despite the centuries, they’ve all survived in remarkable condition.</seg>
<seg id="15">So, why does the Black Sea contain so many well-preserved shipwrecks?</seg>
<seg id="16">In prehistoric times, the land surrounding the Black Sea hosted early human settlements.</seg>
<seg id="17">Eventually, it became a hub for trade, battle, and empire-building because of its strategic position between eastern and western Eurasian civilizations.</seg>
<seg id="18">For thousands of years, it was traversed by merchants, pirates, and warriors.</seg>
<seg id="19">And with sustained seafaring activity came inevitable losses.</seg>
<seg id="20">But unlike other bodies of water in the region, the Black Sea is a particularly deep, semi-enclosed basin.</seg>
<seg id="21">Seasonal changes usually cause the layers within a contained body of water to mix together, oxygenating the water.</seg>
<seg id="22">But because the Black Sea is fed with fresh water from European rivers, and saltwater from the Mediterranean Sea, it contains two distinct layers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The denser saltwater flows beneath the freshwater, where it remains permanently, making the Black Sea the world’s largest meromictic— or un-mixing— basin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Oxygen doesn’t reach its lower, saltier zone, which creates the ideal environment for preservation, and is why the Black Sea has been called “the world’s biggest pickle jar.” In other bodies of water, marine organisms decompose materials over time.</seg>
<seg id="25">Had the ancient Greek ship sunk in the Mediterranean, for example, there would likely be no organic material left today.</seg>
<seg id="26">But in the depths of the Black Sea, only anaerobic bacteria— those that don’t require oxygen— can survive.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is why ancient ships can still be found carrying their original cargo, with carvings in their wood, and their rigging still assembled.</seg>
<seg id="28">Among the recent findings was a medieval Italian merchant ship, likely from around the time Italy had a virtual monopoly over Black Sea trade.</seg>
<seg id="29">Venetian traveler Marco Polo would’ve probably been familiar with this kind of ship.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although vessels like this one helped to modernize Europe, contemporary scholars had never before seen such a complete example.</seg>
<seg id="31">And it was largely intact— a ship’s boat still lying on its deck, even though some seven centuries had passed.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many of the 65 ships that were recently uncovered have retained their original forms.</seg>
<seg id="33">But while there are far fewer degradative forces at play in the Black Sea’s depths, anaerobic bacteria do gradually weaken organic materials.</seg>
<seg id="34">When researchers lifted a plank from the ancient Greek wreck for dating, it broke under its own weight.</seg>
<seg id="35">While the ships are exceptionally well-preserved, they're also fragile.</seg>
<seg id="36">This makes it impossible to bring them to the surface intact.</seg>
<seg id="37">Scientists may carefully remove and study select objects from the wreckages.</seg>
<seg id="38">But the sunken ships will remain protected where they are, perhaps among thousands of others— deep beneath us, suspended in time, at the bottom of the Black Sea.</seg>

<seg id="1">If you were a jackrabbit hopping through the desert, you’d be glad to stumble— well, maybe not stumble— across a cactus: the succulent flesh of these plants is a water source for many desert animals.</seg>
<seg id="2">Native to the Americas and known for their spines and succulent stems, cacti of all shapes and sizes have evolved to not just survive, but thrive, in some of the harshest desert climates on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="3">So how do they do it?</seg>
<seg id="4">A cactus’s spines are one key to its survival— but not for the reason you might think.</seg>
<seg id="5">Take a look at the prickly pear.</seg>
<seg id="6">Its spines are highly modified leaves.</seg>
<seg id="7">A normal leaf’s large surface area would be ill-suited to the desert, transpiring massive amounts of water under the baking sun.</seg>
<seg id="8">The dramatically reduced surface area of the spines limits water loss.</seg>
<seg id="9">They also shade the cactus and reflect the sun’s rays, reducing the plant's core temperature during the heat of the day.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, at night, when air temperatures plummet, the spines act as an insulating layer, keeping the cactus from cooling down too much.</seg>
<seg id="11">These functions are just as important, if not more, than defending against predators.</seg>
<seg id="12">From Cuba to Mexico, and as far south as Brazil and Peru, Melon cacti grow on limestone soils in seasonally dry tropical forests, where they're constantly exposed to the beating sun.</seg>
<seg id="13">They rely on another adaptation common to cacti: a thick skin, which is coated in a waxy substance called a cuticle that limits water loss.</seg>
<seg id="14">Meanwhile, the stomata— tiny holes that allow the exchange of gases that enable photosynthesis— remain firmly closed until night when they open.</seg>
<seg id="15">The lower temperatures at night mean the cactus loses less water from the stem when the stomata open.</seg>
<seg id="16">The bulk of the plant acts as a large barrel of water, storing it for times of need.</seg>
<seg id="17">But to survive the desert, a cactus can’t just limit water loss— it has to be prepared to take full advantage of the rare situations where water is readily available.</seg>
<seg id="18">In North America’s Sonoran Desert, the towering Saguaro cactus can grow up to 20 meters tall and live for up to 200 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Woody tissue, like the kind found in tree trunks, give the Saguaro its height, but the Saguaro survives with way less water than most trees.</seg>
<seg id="20">Most of its roots are only a few inches deep.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just below the soil’s surface, they spread out laterally for meters and hold the plant in place.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even its single deepest root, the taproot, extends less than one meter into the ground.</seg>
<seg id="23">After a rain, the lateral roots respond in real time, rapidly growing and spreading.</seg>
<seg id="24">They produce ephemeral rain roots that quickly take up the available water.</seg>
<seg id="25">The water is then pulled up into the plant body and stored in cells that contain mucilage, a gluey substance that clings to water molecules and stops them from evaporating if the plant’s tissue is ever damaged and exposed.</seg>
<seg id="26">As the soil dries after the rain, the small rain roots also start to dry and wither away, and the cactus awaits the next time it can take advantage of a shower.</seg>
<seg id="27">Taken together, these features make cacti well-equipped to survive their environments, from the driest desert to... a tropical rainforest?</seg>
<seg id="28">The mistletoe cactus can live on the branches of trees in the rainforest.</seg>
<seg id="29">Though there’s lots of water around, not much of it reaches the cactus here, and there's nowhere for its roots to go.</seg>
<seg id="30">So even here, the cactus survives using adaptations that long ago helped its ancestors survive the desert.</seg>

<seg id="1">They call you the human cannonball, but you’re really more of a pinball person.</seg>
<seg id="2">Your act involves flying through a dozen rings of fire, bouncing through a trampoline course, and catching the trapezist in the grand finale.</seg>
<seg id="3">Your cannon has metal coils that accelerate you to the perfect speed.</seg>
<seg id="4">At least it’s supposed to.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today’s pre-flight test fails dramatically, and upon inspection, this is a clear act of sabotage: someone amped the power up to the max.</seg>
<seg id="6">It’s too late to abort the launch; the trapezist will plummet if you don’t catch him in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="7">So you’d better get fixing.</seg>
<seg id="8">The cannon was invented by your eccentric mentor, and as usual, his instructions leave something to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="9">The cannon’s electromagnet is powered by energy cells located in 16 chambers on two levels.</seg>
<seg id="10">Each level is a hollowed out square, with three chambers to a side.</seg>
<seg id="11">The acceleration is survivable if: there are twice as many energy cells in the upper level as in the lower level.</seg>
<seg id="12">Every chamber has 1 to 3 energy cells.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your mentor designed the cannon to use a certain number of energy cells, but when the shipment arrived, it was 3 short.</seg>
<seg id="14">So he made all of those conditions work with this reduced number, and it fired perfectly.</seg>
<seg id="15">That’s the amount you’ll need.</seg>
<seg id="16">Too many, or too few, and you and the trapezist are doomed.</seg>
<seg id="17">How many energy cells should you use, and where?</seg>
<seg id="18">Pause here to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The first step in this puzzle is to narrow the options.</seg>
<seg id="19">Let’s focus on rule 3 in isolation.</seg>
<seg id="20">We could put 11 cells in these two corners and fulfill it with just 22 total cells, because adjacent sides share corners.</seg>
<seg id="21">But if we put 11 in the middle chambers, we could have 44 cells.</seg>
<seg id="22">The answer must be in the range bounded by those extremes.</seg>
<seg id="23">We can use the other rules to refine our options further.</seg>
<seg id="24">Since there are twice as many cells in the upper level, the total cells must be a multiple of 3.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now, because of rule 4, we need to find two consecutive multiples of 3 that can meet all the conditions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Up to this point we haven’t used the rule that each chamber must have 1 to 3 cells.</seg>
<seg id="27">It tells us that the minimum for the lower level is 8 cells, in which case, by rule 1, the upper level would have 16.</seg>
<seg id="28">On every side, the lower level would account for 3 of the 11 cells, so the upper would have to have 8.</seg>
<seg id="29">But if two opposite sides had 8, that would be the upper level’s entire 16, not leaving any for these two chambers.</seg>
<seg id="30">So 24 is out.</seg>
<seg id="31">Let’s look at the other extreme.</seg>
<seg id="32">The upper level can have at most 3 times 8, or 24 cells, which would give a total of 36.</seg>
<seg id="33">That eliminates 39 and 42.</seg>
<seg id="34">With 36, if we had 3 cells in each chamber, each side of the upper level would already have 9 of its 11 cells, meaning we’d have to leave empty chambers on the lower level.</seg>
<seg id="35">So 36 is also out.</seg>
<seg id="36">What about 33?</seg>
<seg id="37">We know we don’t want any sides with all 3′s, so we can place 2′s at opposite corners of the upper level.</seg>
<seg id="38">Now we have 8 of 11 cells per side.</seg>
<seg id="39">So we could place exactly 1 cell in each lower chamber...</seg>
<seg id="40">but that would fall short of the lower level’s required 11.</seg>
<seg id="41">That leaves only two options: 30 and 27, which must work by process of elimination, and 27 is the one you should use.</seg>
<seg id="42">To total 9, the lower level must have seven 1′s and one 2.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you put the 2 in a middle chamber, the upper level would have too many cells.</seg>
<seg id="44">So the 2 has to go into a corner, and you can then place the upper level like this.</seg>
<seg id="45">You’ve barely snapped the last energy cell into place when you hear the ringleader announcing your act.</seg>
<seg id="46">You’re pretty sure you’ve also noticed enough clues to solve the mystery.</seg>
<seg id="47">Who sabotaged you?</seg>

<seg id="1">Nine years ago, I stood on a stage a lot like this one.</seg>
<seg id="2">It was at the TEDWomen conference in Washington, DC, back in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">I was 22 years old, a woman with a college degree.</seg>
<seg id="4">That's nothing too exceptional to say here in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Afghanistan, my homeland, women like me were the exception.</seg>
<seg id="6">It had been a little over a decade since the fall of the Taliban regime.</seg>
<seg id="7">A time when it was quite literally illegal for girls to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Afghan people had spent a decade rebuilding our nation and our lives.</seg>
<seg id="9">And when I stood on the TEDWomen stage, I challenged the world to dare to educate Afghan girls.</seg>
<seg id="10">The way I had just started doing at a place in Kabul called the School of Leadership, Afghanistan, or SOLA.</seg>
<seg id="11">[To] me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="12">And every single day, the girls of SOLA remind me of that.</seg>
<seg id="13">Like me, they are dreaming big.</seg>
<seg id="14">That was then.</seg>
<seg id="15">And this is now.</seg>
<seg id="16">And the Taliban are back.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I want you to know I haven't stopped dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="18">Neither have those girls of SOLA.</seg>
<seg id="19">We have taken our dreams and adapted them.</seg>
<seg id="20">Agility, adaptation, resilience.</seg>
<seg id="21">These concepts are core to everything that SOLA is.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have faced the uncertainty of what might be, and we have turned it into the certainty of what will be.</seg>
<seg id="23">I'll explain.</seg>
<seg id="24">Back in 2012, we ran a program where girls lived at SOLA but primarily studied at high schools in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="25">And we secured scholarships for these girls to pursue their education overseas, including here in America.</seg>
<seg id="26">It worked.</seg>
<seg id="27">It worked well.</seg>
<seg id="28">But I realized I was contributing to something I never wanted to see: a brain drain of Afghanistan’s educated women.</seg>
<seg id="29">So I realized I had to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="30">I wanted to educate Afghan girls who would become educated Afghan women, who would then educate other girls.</seg>
<seg id="31">And all of them together over time would build a new Afghanistan from the bottom up, and they would be among its leaders.</seg>
<seg id="32">I needed a place where these girls would learn to read English and Koran.</seg>
<seg id="33">I needed a place where the administration and instructors would be women.</seg>
<seg id="34">A place where the notion of female leadership -- Afghan female leadership -- would become known for every student.</seg>
<seg id="35">I needed a place that quite simply did not exist in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="36">So my team and I created it.</seg>
<seg id="37">In 2016, SOLA became a full-fledged boarding school for girls.</seg>
<seg id="38">The first and only in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="39">That year, we enrolled 24 girls in sixth grade.</seg>
<seg id="40">By 2021, we had enrolled nearly 100 girls in grades six to 11.</seg>
<seg id="41">I'll tell you something I'm very proud of.</seg>
<seg id="42">In 2016, we drew girls from 14 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces.</seg>
<seg id="43">This year, we have girls from 28 provinces.</seg>
<seg id="44">Imagine you are a girl from one of these provinces coming to SOLA.</seg>
<seg id="45">You've probably never lived away from your family.</seg>
<seg id="46">As you can see, we have obscured their faces for their safety.</seg>
<seg id="47">But when you arrive on campus, an older sister will be there for you.</seg>
<seg id="48">She will be beside you as you pray in the campus mosque; she will eat with you; she will help you with your schoolwork.</seg>
<seg id="49">You are from different provinces, different ethnicities, but you are united by sisterhood.</seg>
<seg id="50">By your identity as Afghan girls.</seg>
<seg id="51">Educating girls, breaking barriers, this is what we do at SOLA.</seg>
<seg id="52">We became known for this nationwide.</seg>
<seg id="53">Parents came to us from across Afghanistan asking us to admit their daughters.</seg>
<seg id="54">I remember one father in particular, from a rural province, and one of his daughters was already a student with us.</seg>
<seg id="55">This was back in 2019, and I remember him coming to campus and sitting in my office.</seg>
<seg id="56">He was trying to convince me to admit another one of his daughters.</seg>
<seg id="57">On his way out, he stopped in the doorway, turned around and looked at me, and completely calmly, he said, "When the Taliban come back, please promise that you will burn my daughter's records. If the Taliban know my daughter studies here, they will kill my family."</seg>
<seg id="58">Remember, this was 2019.</seg>
<seg id="59">Two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="60">He didn't say "if the Taliban come back."</seg>
<seg id="61">He said "when."</seg>
<seg id="62">I promised him that I would do what he asked.</seg>
<seg id="63">And this summer ...</seg>
<seg id="64">I did.</seg>
<seg id="65">What you're seeing here are the records of my students burning.</seg>
<seg id="66">We set this fire to protect every girl who's ever studied at SOLA.</seg>
<seg id="67">This was mid-August.</seg>
<seg id="68">Right as the Taliban were about to enter Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="69">Less than two weeks later, nearly 250 members of the SOLA community, students, staff and family members, were out of Afghanistan and safe in the nation of Rwanda.</seg>
<seg id="70">I will say this again.</seg>
<seg id="71">When you face the uncertainty of what might be, you can turn it into the certainty of what will be.</seg>
<seg id="72">SOLA's departure from Afghanistan made headlines.</seg>
<seg id="73">And I think it has drawn the attention partly because how swiftly the Taliban took over Afghanistan and how quickly so much of what was beautiful about my country turned to dust.</seg>
<seg id="74">But what these stories don't usually tell you is that we had been quietly planning for this day of our departure for most of the year.</seg>
<seg id="75">I had that conversation with my student's father in December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="76">The United States signed an agreement with the Taliban in February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="77">And the US announced its unconditional withdrawal from Afghanistan in April 2021.</seg>
<seg id="78">These dates were like signposts on a road I never wanted to be on.</seg>
<seg id="79">I couldn't see far enough down that road to be certain about it's end.</seg>
<seg id="80">But what I was certain of was that I would not sit passively by and let that road lead me.</seg>
<seg id="81">This spring, we started making plans to bring our students overseas for a study abroad program.</seg>
<seg id="82">This takes time.</seg>
<seg id="83">We needed to identify potential host nations; we needed parents to grant permission; we needed to speak with officials and gather our resources.</seg>
<seg id="84">It takes time, and all the while you're moving down that road, going faster, gaining momentum toward what lies at the end.</seg>
<seg id="85">There is a lot about this that I still cannot talk about.</seg>
<seg id="86">Some of it is for security reasons.</seg>
<seg id="87">And some of it is for personal reasons.</seg>
<seg id="88">This is still very raw for me.</seg>
<seg id="89">I never imagined Afghanistan would fall as fast as it did.</seg>
<seg id="90">No one imagined it.</seg>
<seg id="91">But I will tell you this.</seg>
<seg id="92">On August 1, we were bringing our students back to Kabul after their semester break.</seg>
<seg id="93">On August 15, the Taliban were in Kabul and in control.</seg>
<seg id="94">And on August 30, we were holding our second day of classes at our new campus in Rwanda with our entire community together and safe.</seg>
<seg id="95">That is how fast things can move.</seg>
<seg id="96">And that's what anyone, not just me, but anyone can accomplish when you accept the uncertainty of what might be, and through careful contingency planning, turn it into the certainty of what will be.</seg>
<seg id="97">You will find yourself somewhere new.</seg>
<seg id="98">And different.</seg>
<seg id="99">Adapting and succeeding.</seg>
<seg id="100">And sometimes, you will know you have left a light on to help you find your way home.</seg>
<seg id="101">What you're seeing here is something that I very rarely show publicly.</seg>
<seg id="102">Earlier, I talked about SOLA's campus in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="103">That campus is a series of rented buildings that we have converted into classroom and residential space.</seg>
<seg id="104">But what you're seeing here is something very different.</seg>
<seg id="105">This is a perimeter wall that rings a parcel of land in the heart of Kabul city, land that SOLA holds legal rights to.</seg>
<seg id="106">This is the land where we're going to build a permanent campus, where Afghan girls will come to live and study in safety.</seg>
<seg id="107">We cleared this land ourselves, all 18,000 cubic meters of landfill.</seg>
<seg id="108">We raised this wall ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="109">We knew we would face opposition, and we planned for it.</seg>
<seg id="110">We spoke with our neighbors, explaining how valuable an educated girl is to her family, explaining how one day their daughters could apply to study at SOLA.</seg>
<seg id="111">And our neighbors became some of our strongest allies.</seg>
<seg id="112">We spoke with high-level government officials who complained that this land was too valuable to be wasted on educating girls.</seg>
<seg id="113">And we convinced them otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="114">Those officials, of course, aren't in government anymore.</seg>
<seg id="115">Afghanistan has new leaders.</seg>
<seg id="116">And while this is a sensitive topic, I can say that it's quite possible that construction on this new campus might resume relatively soon.</seg>
<seg id="117">Time will tell.</seg>
<seg id="118">Nine years ago, I stood on a TEDWomen stage, and I said Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="119">And every single day, the girls of SOLA remind me of that.</seg>
<seg id="120">Like me, they are dreaming big.</seg>
<seg id="121">Earlier this year, I was on SOLA's campus in Kabul interviewing a girl who was applying for sixth grade.</seg>
<seg id="122">I asked her why she wanted to come to SOLA, which is a question I ask all our applicants.</seg>
<seg id="123">She said, "I have dreamed of this. I've dreamed of coming to SOLA ever since I was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="124">In all these years that I have interviewed girls from across Afghanistan, this was the first time that a young girl said that to me.</seg>
<seg id="125">Why do I keep doing what I do, despite the risk that comes with it and all the uncertainty?</seg>
<seg id="126">Because Afghanistan is a country of hope and dreams.</seg>
<seg id="127">It's my home.</seg>
<seg id="128">And it always will be.</seg>
<seg id="129">And now, out there in the most remote corners of Afghanistan, are young girls, dreaming to attend SOLA.</seg>
<seg id="130">My community, my students are settling and thriving in Rwanda.</seg>
<seg id="131">And I'm so grateful we're there.</seg>
<seg id="132">I see Afghanistan now through TV news reports or on my phone, when friends, still in Afghanistan, call me.</seg>
<seg id="133">But SOLA is there too.</seg>
<seg id="134">We have planted roots that can never be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="135">Nine years ago, I challenged the world to dare to educate Afghan girls.</seg>
<seg id="136">Those girls are young women now.</seg>
<seg id="137">And they will do what Afghan women have always done.</seg>
<seg id="138">Meet uncertainty head on and rise above it.</seg>
<seg id="139">I know they will do their part.</seg>
<seg id="140">But they, we need something from you, all of you here and watching this.</seg>
<seg id="141">So today I issue another challenge to the world.</seg>
<seg id="142">Do not look away.</seg>
<seg id="143">As the noise dies down, and Afghanistan slips from the front pages, do not look away.</seg>
<seg id="144">In nine years, it will be the year 2030.</seg>
<seg id="145">It's the year I will celebrate my 40th birthday.</seg>
<seg id="146">So here is my dream, my birthday wish.</seg>
<seg id="147">In nine years, I hope to be speaking with you again from SOLA’s campus in Kabul, with all of my students there.</seg>
<seg id="148">I will see you then, if you do not look away.</seg>
<seg id="149">Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="1">Peering into the eyes of different animals, you’ll see some extraordinarily shaped pupils.</seg>
<seg id="2">But why?</seg>
<seg id="3">It turns out that pupil shape is a powerful indicator of what role an animal plays in its ecosystem.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pupils mark the hollow opening in the iris, the eye’s band of pigmented muscle.</seg>
<seg id="5">They’re the portholes through which light enters the eye, where it then strikes the retina and activates light-sensitive cells, setting the process of vision in motion.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pupils are black because most of the light that enters them is absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their size changes in response to brightness, as well as certain drugs and emotional and mental states— but their basic form varies greatly among species.</seg>
<seg id="8">House cats, for one, are twilight hunters with vertically elongated pupils.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the dark, these structures expand dramatically, taking in the available light.</seg>
<seg id="10">When it’s bright, they shrink into slits.</seg>
<seg id="11">In fact, cat pupils are so flexible that their maximum area is 135 times greater than their minimum area— whereas our pupils only shrink and expand 15-fold.</seg>
<seg id="12">And because of how the slit pupil takes in light, it creates sharp, vertical contours.</seg>
<seg id="13">When the cat’s brain processes the visuals from each eye, the small but sharp differences between them help the cat judge the precise distance of its target.</seg>
<seg id="14">In fact, many other ambush hunters also have vertically elongated pupils— but mainly those whose eyes are located closer to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="15">This may be because these pupils are especially useful in perceiving objects at the relative short distances these animals tend to hunt.</seg>
<seg id="16">The world looks very different from behind the horizontally elongated pupils of many grazing and browsing animals, like goats.</seg>
<seg id="17">These pupils, situated on either side of the head, let horizontal bands of light in that give the goat a near-360-degree view and provide it with sharp, horizontal images.</seg>
<seg id="18">This helps goats detect any disruption to the horizon— alerting them to potential predators— while still enabling them to see ahead and detect obstacles as they make their escape.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, goats always keep their pupils aligned with the horizon, rotating their eyeballs in their sockets as they move their heads up and down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Meanwhile, nocturnal geckos have pupils that shrink into slits studded with pinholes in higher light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="21">Each pinhole projects a separate, sharp image onto the geckos retina.</seg>
<seg id="22">Scientists think that comparing these different inputs might help the gecko judge distance without having to move.</seg>
<seg id="23">And while they might have fooled you, mantises and other insects and crustaceans have “pseudopupils.” These aren’t optical structures; they’re optical illusions experienced by the observer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mantises have compound eyes composed of thousands of light-sensing units.</seg>
<seg id="25">When some are aimed at you, they appear black because they’re absorbing most wavelengths of incoming light— but there’s no actual opening.</seg>
<seg id="26">So, why do we have round pupils?</seg>
<seg id="27">Elongated pupils help sharpen certain dimensions of an animal's vision.</seg>
<seg id="28">But scientists think that, for animals like us with circular pupils, this is a lower priority.</seg>
<seg id="29">Instead of seeing some elements of a scene in extreme focus, we see a larger picture in relative detail, which enables more general skills of observation.</seg>
<seg id="30">This may be especially helpful for foragers looking for food, hunters eyeballing and chasing their prey, and social animals recognizing other faces.</seg>
<seg id="31">As we peer at different pupils, patterns emerge.</seg>
<seg id="32">And yet there are exceptions.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, Pallas’s cats and mongooses are both small ambush predators, but the Pallas’s cat has round pupils and mongooses have goat-like pupils.</seg>
<seg id="34">And we’ve only explored a few pupil shapes.</seg>
<seg id="35">Other animals have crescent- or heart-shaped pupils.</seg>
<seg id="36">And the cuttlefish has perhaps some of the most bizarre: their pupils are circular in the dark, but W-shaped in the light.</seg>
<seg id="37">So, what’s going on here?</seg>
<seg id="38">Well, wouldn’t we all like to know?</seg>

<seg id="1">Every morning, Helios harnessed his winged horses, unleashed his golden chariot, and set out across the sky.</seg>
<seg id="2">As the Sun God transformed the rosy dawn into the golden blooms of day, he thought of those far below.</seg>
<seg id="3">Years ago, he fell in love with a water nymph named Clymene.</seg>
<seg id="4">Together, they had seven daughters and one son named Phaethon.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Helios had a wandering eye.</seg>
<seg id="6">Clymene eventually left him, taking their children with her and marrying King Merops of Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="7">When Phaethon was little, Clymene told him tales of his divine father.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he grew into a young man, he took a special pride in knowing he was the Sun God’s child.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, one day, Epaphus, Phaethon’s peer who was himself the son of Zeus, sought to temper Phaethon’s arrogance, taunting that Helios wasn’t his father after all.</seg>
<seg id="10">With no absolute proof to the contrary, the possibility bore into Phaethon’s mind.</seg>
<seg id="11">He feared that his mother had lied.</seg>
<seg id="12">And who was he if not Helios’ son?</seg>
<seg id="13">When Phaethon confronted Clymene, she insisted that his father was the powerful Sun God.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nevertheless, Phaethon was seized by doubt.</seg>
<seg id="15">So, Clymene sent him off to ask Helios directly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Walking eastward, Phaethon entered the Sun God’s gleaming palace at last.</seg>
<seg id="17">Once his eyes adjusted to the brightness, he saw Helios’ radiant smile and open arms.</seg>
<seg id="18">When Phaethon expressed his skepticism that Helios was truly his father, the Sun God only beamed.</seg>
<seg id="19">To dispel all doubt, he would grant Phaethon anything he wanted.</seg>
<seg id="20">Basking in Helios’ glow, Phaethon felt there was but one way to prove their connection to the world— and himself.</seg>
<seg id="21">He needed to drive Helios’ chariot for a day.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Sun God’s smile dimmed.</seg>
<seg id="23">In his daily journey, he steered his fire-breathing horses through space at top speeds.</seg>
<seg id="24">The task required masterful control to ensure that the chariot raced along its precise celestial trajectory, with a thin margin separating stability from catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even Zeus wasn’t confident in driving his chariot.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helios begged his son to reconsider, but Phaethon was steadfast, so the god prepared him for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="27">With a crack of the reins, he was off.</seg>
<seg id="28">In flight, Phaethon’s mortal insecurities fell away.</seg>
<seg id="29">But soon, the reins slackened in his hands.</seg>
<seg id="30">Unaccustomed to the feathery weight of a mortal, the radiant horses climbed higher and higher.</seg>
<seg id="31">The chariot whirled past constellations, narrowly missing the pincers of Scorpio and the arrow of Sagittarius.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the Sun so far away, the Earth darkened, and the seas began to crackle and freeze.</seg>
<seg id="33">Startled, Phaethon sharply pulled the reins.</seg>
<seg id="34">The horses lurched and the chariot plunged towards the Earth's surface.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lakes boiled and forests burned as Phaethon struggled to pull the chariot up, leaving deserts in his wake.</seg>
<seg id="36">Back on Mount Olympus, the Gods were panicking.</seg>
<seg id="37">Zeus saw that Phaethon was destined for a crash that would set the Earth ablaze.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, he hurled one of his mighty thunderbolts at the boy.</seg>
<seg id="39">The horses tore away, leaving Phaethon suspended in the heavens for just one moment, before he plummeted to the Earth, into the river Eridanus, never to resurface.</seg>
<seg id="40">Phaethon’s sisters gathered on the riverbank to weep, gradually metamorphosing into poplar trees that leaked precious amber into the water.</seg>
<seg id="41">Zeus repaired the Earth and created an everlasting memorial, strewing Phaethon’s likeness in the stars.</seg>
<seg id="42">Overcome by grief, Helios had hidden himself from the sky.</seg>
<seg id="43">But he soon returned, and every day from then on, as he raced through the heavens, he greeted his son.</seg>
<seg id="44">The constellation, known as “Auriga,” or “the charioteer,” stands as a reminder of a lost young man, and his bid to harness powers far greater than himself.</seg>

<seg id="1">"How many times must a man look up Before he can see the sky?"</seg>
<seg id="2">That's a quote from a famous song by Bob Dylan.</seg>
<seg id="3">I love that line because it reminds me that sometimes what we need is actually right there in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="4">I will argue that that is also the case with climate change.</seg>
<seg id="5">We can actually replace some of the biggest sources of the problem, oil, coal and gas, with something we have in abundance: wind.</seg>
<seg id="6">In my country, Denmark, we are doing just that.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now we are a small country with a small population.</seg>
<seg id="8">If you haven't visited yet, please do so.</seg>
<seg id="9">We are all friendly people.</seg>
<seg id="10">As long as you don't criticize our national football team.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nothing makes a Dane proud like the knowledge that something we have done makes a positive difference in the world.</seg>
<seg id="12">Historically speaking, we’ve made a difference before.</seg>
<seg id="13">1,000 years ago, countrymen of mine controlled most of northern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="14">I'm sure you've heard of them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Big, strong guys, helmets, beards, long hair.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Vikings.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now I will make the case today that in order for us to fight climate change, we actually need to learn from the Vikings.</seg>
<seg id="18">But before we get to that, please indulge me.</seg>
<seg id="19">We have to go somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="20">I have to say go back in time.</seg>
<seg id="21">Not all the way back to the Viking age in the heydays of Harald "Bluetooth," but to the 1970s during the oil crisis in Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not to a Viking fortress, but to a small workshop, in a barn, in a farm, in a village in Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="23">Meets Henrik Stiesdal.</seg>
<seg id="24">He’s not an accomplished, experienced engineer.</seg>
<seg id="25">He's 19 years old, a young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">He set himself a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="27">He thought, "What if I could make a wind turbine that could produce electricity?"</seg>
<seg id="28">And you know what?</seg>
<seg id="29">He did.</seg>
<seg id="30">How do I know?</seg>
<seg id="31">Because that's it.</seg>
<seg id="32">Not a model, not a replica.</seg>
<seg id="33">This is the actual one that Henrik made.</seg>
<seg id="34">He was kind enough to lend it to me.</seg>
<seg id="35">It says M1 on it.</seg>
<seg id="36">That stands for "mølle one," "mølle et" which translates into "turbine number one."</seg>
<seg id="37">And of course, this was just the first one he made.</seg>
<seg id="38">Later, he managed to build a big one that could supply his family with cheap, affordable electricity in the middle of the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="39">And soon after that, other farms asked Henrik to build a turbine for them as well.</seg>
<seg id="40">And he did.</seg>
<seg id="41">And eventually he actually sold the design to a company called Vestas.</seg>
<seg id="42">You might have heard of them because they are the biggest turbine producer in the world today.</seg>
<seg id="43">So this is how Henrik’s invention became a sort of the prototype for many, many of the wind turbines that you'll see all over the planet today.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now a lot of things have happened since Henrik and other pioneers took the first steps back in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1991, we built the first offshore wind farm in the world called Vindeby.</seg>
<seg id="46">Eleven turbines, 54 meters tall.</seg>
<seg id="47">That was considered a landmark.</seg>
<seg id="48">They were huge.</seg>
<seg id="49">Today, of course, they seem pretty tiny.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is Kriegers Flak.</seg>
<seg id="51">That's the biggest offshore wind farm in Denmark now.</seg>
<seg id="52">72 turbines, 188 meters tall, each of them.</seg>
<seg id="53">To give you a comparison, that's twice the height of the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="54">Every time one of those turbines has one rotation of the blades, it creates enough electricity to charge more than 1,400 cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="55">The park itself covers the electricity demand of 600,000 households.</seg>
<seg id="56">So the story of wind power in Denmark is the story about how one turbine, on one farm sparked a transformation that influenced the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="57">We, of course, now hope, small as we may be, that we can spark a transformation that will also affect other countries.</seg>
<seg id="58">We are a green frontrunner, but we need to do more because at the same time, we rank number one in the EU, or at least as one of the biggest oil producers, in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="59">This has to change.</seg>
<seg id="60">And it will.</seg>
<seg id="61">Last year, the Danish government and the Danish parliament made an important decision.</seg>
<seg id="62">We’ve decided to put an end date on extraction of oil and gas in 2050 and immediately cancel all future licensing rounds.</seg>
<seg id="63">That wasn't an easy decision.</seg>
<seg id="64">When we made the decision, we were the biggest oil producer in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="65">But the reason we made it, even though it was expensive, was because we need to show the world that there are actually alternatives to oil and gas.</seg>
<seg id="66">Now, some of you are probably thinking that sounds very good, but how will you do it?</seg>
<seg id="67">What do you do the days when the wind doesn't blow?</seg>
<seg id="68">And what about the parts of our energy system that cannot be electrified?</seg>
<seg id="69">Surely you cannot fly a jet plane without jet fuels?</seg>
<seg id="70">Surely you cannot sail a big container ship without bunker oil?</seg>
<seg id="71">But actually, you can.</seg>
<seg id="72">This is an electrolyzer.</seg>
<seg id="73">The photo is from a visit I paid a factory in Denmark a few weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="74">So it's not a prototype, it's not a model in a lab.</seg>
<seg id="75">It's a functioning machine, it's a commercial product.</seg>
<seg id="76">What does it do?</seg>
<seg id="77">It transforms electricity into hydrogen.</seg>
<seg id="78">And that, friends, that's the game changer.</seg>
<seg id="79">Because it makes it possible for us to solve two problems we have with wind energy.</seg>
<seg id="80">One, we can now store the energy for when the wind is not blowing.</seg>
<seg id="81">And two, we can now decarbonize parts of our energy system that we couldn't decarbonize before.</seg>
<seg id="82">Because the hydrogen can be transformed into green fuels.</seg>
<seg id="83">Imagine that.</seg>
<seg id="84">The wind in the North Sea is transformed by a turbine into electricity.</seg>
<seg id="85">The electrolyzer transforms that into hydrogen, and the hydrogen is then made into green, sustainable fuels that we can use to sail our ships and fly our planes.</seg>
<seg id="86">I know it sounds like science fiction, but actually it's just science.</seg>
<seg id="87">Now in order for us to do that at a scale that we need, we will need a lot of renewable energy.</seg>
<seg id="88">We will need to massively expand our offshore wind capacity.</seg>
<seg id="89">And in Denmark, we're doing just that.</seg>
<seg id="90">A very important part of that strategy is to build the world's first energy island.</seg>
<seg id="91">This is a simulation of what it may end up looking like.</seg>
<seg id="92">80 kilometers out in the sea, the size of 64 football fields, the biggest infrastructure investment in Danish history.</seg>
<seg id="93">We're changing literally the map of our country.</seg>
<seg id="94">Hundreds of wind turbines around it.</seg>
<seg id="95">When fully scaled, it'll be able to generate 10 gigawatts of green electricity.</seg>
<seg id="96">Now 10 gigawatts, that's enough to cover the demand of 10 million households.</seg>
<seg id="97">That's far more than we need in Denmark, which is good news, because then we can use it to make the hydrogen, to make the green fuels, and we can export it to other countries and thereby help them decarbonize their energy systems.</seg>
<seg id="98">Some of you are probably thinking, "What does this have to do with the Vikings?"</seg>
<seg id="99">But do you know what it was that made the Vikings so successful?</seg>
<seg id="100">How they managed to go to Greenland?</seg>
<seg id="101">How they managed to sail to America 500 years before Christopher Columbus?</seg>
<seg id="102">Their secret?</seg>
<seg id="103">They exploited the wind.</seg>
<seg id="104">They put tremendous effort into making efficient sails, and it took as a long time for them to make a sail as it did to build a ship, and it was just as important.</seg>
<seg id="105">And that brings me to my main point.</seg>
<seg id="106">We need, as the Vikings did 1,000 years ago, to change the world by finding new and more efficient ways of exploiting the energy.</seg>
<seg id="107">This time, with slightly better haircuts --</seg>
<seg id="108">and the motivation that lies in the fact that this may be our biggest chance of making a positive difference in fighting climate change.</seg>
<seg id="109">Now, some people will probably tell you that a small country cannot make a big difference.</seg>
<seg id="110">I beg to differ.</seg>
<seg id="111">When a young man like Henrik could make a difference for a whole country, why not also believe that a country like Denmark can make a difference for a whole world?</seg>
<seg id="112">We can't do it alone, but we can do a lot.</seg>
<seg id="113">By innovating, by creating new technology and new solutions, by exploiting something that is much bigger than ourselves, the forces of nature.</seg>
<seg id="114">If you ask the International Energy Agency, they will tell you that offshore wind has the potential to cover the current electricity demand of the entire world, not once, not twice, 18 times.</seg>
<seg id="115">So when you go to Denmark, you’ll meet a Dane.</seg>
<seg id="116">After you have said something nice about our football team,</seg>
<seg id="117">try and ask her, "How do you think we should solve the climate crisis?"</seg>
<seg id="118">Chances are, she will say, "The answer, my friend, is literally blowing in the wind."</seg>
<seg id="119">Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the 1930s, American industrialist Henry Ford had one overwhelming obsession: soybeans.</seg>
<seg id="2">He extracted their oil to make enamel for painting his cars.</seg>
<seg id="3">He crushed them into powder to make plastic parts.</seg>
<seg id="4">And he encouraged American farmers to grow as much of the plant as possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">But he wasn’t just feeding soy to machines.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the Chicago World’s Fair, he hosted a soy-centric feast.</seg>
<seg id="7">The ingredient had been a staple in Asian cuisine for centuries, but Ford’s dinner— full of soy substitutes for dairy, meat and wheat— took the integration of soy into food a step further.</seg>
<seg id="8">Today, soy is in so many foods that most people consume it every day without even knowing it.</seg>
<seg id="9">So what makes soybeans so versatile?</seg>
<seg id="10">And is our global obsession healthy or harmful?</seg>
<seg id="11">Soybeans have been cultivated in Asia as early as 5,500 years ago, but since then they’ve spread across the globe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Part of soy’s success is that the crop can be grown easily and cheaply in variable conditions.</seg>
<seg id="13">And once they’re grown, soybeans have an incredibly high density of proteins and fats; ingredients which in recent years have been used in everything from mayonnaise to biodegradable plastic.</seg>
<seg id="14">The ideal method for separating these components depends on what you’re trying to extract.</seg>
<seg id="15">To isolate soy proteins, dehulled beans are sometimes pressed through rollers to create thin flakes, and then steeped in water to draw out the proteins.</seg>
<seg id="16">Alternatively, whole beans can be simply soaked and ground into a whitish, protein rich liquid.</seg>
<seg id="17">In both cases, the resulting substance can be used to make spongy foods like tofu or filtered to produce soymilk.</seg>
<seg id="18">And at the industrial scale, these proteins can be used in various ways to help make processed foods.</seg>
<seg id="19">Soy fats may be even more versatile.</seg>
<seg id="20">In one extraction method, soybeans are dried, cleaned, and then fed into an extruder.</seg>
<seg id="21">This machine simultaneously heats and presses the beans, producing a liquid containing soy oil and other fatty components.</seg>
<seg id="22">By adding water and spinning the mixture, components are separated into two parts: refined soy oil for things like salad dressing, and a substance called lecithin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Lecithin is made of molecules called phospholipids, which have a phosphate head that attracts water and a tail that attracts fats.</seg>
<seg id="24">These features make phospholipids excellent for blending ingredients that naturally separate from each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">This process is called emulsification and soy lecithins are used as an emulsifying agent in a huge variety of foods.</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, during chocolate production phospholipids attach to both the fatty components of the cocoa butter and the water-soluble sugar particles, making them easier to combine into a smooth mixture.</seg>
<seg id="27">A similar process happens in powdered products that need to be instantly rehydrated.</seg>
<seg id="28">Soy lecithin bonds with the water and helps the powder disperse more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="29">While there are other plants we can process for lecithin and proteins, soy’s mild taste and widespread availability have earned it a place in thousands of food products.</seg>
<seg id="30">But is it unhealthy to be eating this much soy?</seg>
<seg id="31">Not really.</seg>
<seg id="32">Soybeans contain many of the essential amino acids our bodies need, making them one of the best ways to get these proteins without eating meat.</seg>
<seg id="33">And the beans’ fat content is largely made up of so-called “good” fats— poly and mono-unsaturated fatty acids, which can decrease cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="34">There are some compounds in soy that may inhibit our body’s absorption of various minerals.</seg>
<seg id="35">And about 0.3% of the general population has a soy allergy, which can be severe in rare cases.</seg>
<seg id="36">But for many people, the biggest complaint about soy consumption is the occasional increase in flatulence.</seg>
<seg id="37">Outside our bodies however, soy is much more worrying.</seg>
<seg id="38">To accommodate the soy farms needed for heavy industry, processed foods and livestock feed, huge swaths of land have been deforested.</seg>
<seg id="39">Between 2006 and 2017, roughly 22,000 square kilometers of the Amazon were cleared for soy production.</seg>
<seg id="40">In some regions, this has also led to the displacement of farmers and indigenous communities.</seg>
<seg id="41">So if we want to keep using soy and all its byproducts, we’ll need to find a way to do it humanely and sustainably.</seg>

<seg id="1">On February 24, my daughter spoke for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">First word was “ba-bah,” which means the sound of a great explosion.</seg>
<seg id="3">That night, we woke to the concussive sound of bombs as our windows came crashing in.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was the bombardment of Kyiv.</seg>
<seg id="5">I'm someone who didn't believe it would happen.</seg>
<seg id="6">I was born just a few days before the Chernobyl disaster and a few years before the collapse of the Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="7">I grew up in an independent Ukraine, struggling to overcome the legacy of the Soviet system.</seg>
<seg id="8">My mother and my grandmother worked very hard so that I could have a good education because they believed my generation would build the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">And we have.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until six weeks ago, Ukraine was on an upward path, becoming more prosperous, more fair, more free.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2004 and 2013, we marched for democracy, and we defeated autocracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">So I was stunned when the windows crushed in.</seg>
<seg id="13">I froze.</seg>
<seg id="14">Speechless, motionless, absolutely helpless.</seg>
<seg id="15">That was my first lesson of war.</seg>
<seg id="16">What you cherish can be taken from you in a moment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even your peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="18">My hands were still shaking as I fled to the west of Ukraine with my children and then over the border to Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="19">My husband and my parents remain in Kyiv, helping our country.</seg>
<seg id="20">As we traveled further from our family, I imagined all that was being destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="21">Our homes, our hospitals, our critical infrastructure and so much more.</seg>
<seg id="22">For 40 million people in my country and for billions around the globe, February 24 is the day Russia invaded Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="23">For seven million Ukrainian children, it is also the day Russia tried to take their future.</seg>
<seg id="24">176 children have been killed by Russian bombs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hundreds more have been wounded.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ten years ago, I dedicated myself to building world-class schools for the children of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="27">I believe education is the most powerful tool for improving the economy, the environment and human well-being.</seg>
<seg id="28">War very quickly destroys all three.</seg>
<seg id="29">So far, 900 schools have been critically damaged.</seg>
<seg id="30">84 are completely destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="31">And yet, education goes on.</seg>
<seg id="32">During the COVID pandemic, Ukrainian government engaged my team to create the Ukrainian school online.</seg>
<seg id="33">During the last two years, it has delivered school to children wherever they were.</seg>
<seg id="34">Students from remote areas had access to teachers and lessons they wouldn't have otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="35">This platform covers the secondary school curriculum and puts every student in front of our very best teachers.</seg>
<seg id="36">We never imagined our nonprofit project would be needed in a situation even more horrible than COVID.</seg>
<seg id="37">But today, almost 400,000 students learn on this platform.</seg>
<seg id="38">They connect from within Ukraine and from 120 countries where they are refugees at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="39">And for all of them, those couple of hours a day is not just a safe environment where they learn something new.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is also the space where, despite everything, Ukraine continues to invest in them.</seg>
<seg id="41">And that was my second lesson of war.</seg>
<seg id="42">Putin can take a lot from us.</seg>
<seg id="43">Our homes, our jobs, our loved ones, our peace.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he cannot undo education.</seg>
<seg id="45">Knowledge and curiosity are unassailable treasures.</seg>
<seg id="46">And as long as our children keep learning and our teachers keep teaching, even while they are starving in shelters under bombardment, even in refugee camps, we are undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="47">In this war, every Ukrainian has his own front.</seg>
<seg id="48">Our soldiers, our doctors, our mothers.</seg>
<seg id="49">And, yes, even our children and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="50">By continuing to learn, they fight for our future.</seg>
<seg id="51">And this fight is about so much more than borders.</seg>
<seg id="52">Ukrainians are fighting for freedom, for our right to imagine and build our future in our own way.</seg>
<seg id="53">But against the second-largest army in the world, we cannot stand alone.</seg>
<seg id="54">To end this war, we need you.</seg>
<seg id="55">We need every citizen in every nation to demand that it stops.</seg>
<seg id="56">And that was my third lesson.</seg>
<seg id="57">My freedom is connected to yours.</seg>
<seg id="58">My daughter's first word was the sound of destruction.</seg>
<seg id="59">But as she grows, I know she and the rest of her generation will build Ukraine again.</seg>
<seg id="60">We will rehabilitate our roads, our schools, our hospitals, our houses and people.</seg>
<seg id="61">Fueled by knowledge and curiosity, we will walk again the path to become a prosperous, free nation.</seg>
<seg id="62">If you stand with us.</seg>
<seg id="63">So please, don't watch from the side.</seg>
<seg id="64">Don't wait and see.</seg>
<seg id="65">Stand up with us now.</seg>
<seg id="66">Stand up for freedom.</seg>
<seg id="67">Stand up for democracy.</seg>
<seg id="68">Stand up for Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="69">Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="1">On a tiny copper globe created in the early 1500s, the coast of Southeast Asia is marked with a message that has since become iconic: Here be dragons.</seg>
<seg id="2">Though the words themselves were actually quite rare, the sentiment was common among medieval European mapmakers, who often scrawled dragons and sea monsters over terra incognita— blank spots on the map.</seg>
<seg id="3">For thousands of years, people all over the world had made both functional maps— showing trade routes, settlements, topography, water sources, the shapes of coastlines, or written directions— and what are known as cosmographies, illustrating the Earth and its position in the cosmos, often including constellations, gods, and mythic locations.</seg>
<seg id="4">From the Middle Ages through the mid-17th century, cartographers in Eurasia and North Africa produced a slew of new world maps with features from both these traditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Often commissioned by rulers and other powerful people, these maps were meant to depict the world’s geography, but not necessarily to be useful for navigation.</seg>
<seg id="6">And given their maker’s incomplete knowledge of the world, they were really hypotheses— some of which have been glaringly disproven.</seg>
<seg id="7">In medieval Europe, the new vogue began with what were known as mappae mundi.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many of these veered closer to cosmographies, featuring the Garden of Eden or mythical dragons.</seg>
<seg id="9">They all followed the same format, showing the world's land as one mass divided roughly into the shape of a T and surrounded by a ring of ocean.</seg>
<seg id="10">Islamic mapmakers also created world maps in this format, emphasizing geographic details over fantastical elements.</seg>
<seg id="11">One of the earliest and most accurate such maps was created by Ibn Hawqal, whose own travels informed his mapmaking.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 1154, the King of Sicily commissioned Islamic mapmaker Al-Idrisi to create the “Tabula Rogeriana,” also known as “A Guide to Pleasant Journeys into Faraway Lands.” This book of maps included a world map based on Idrisi’s own travel and interviews with other traders and travelers.</seg>
<seg id="13">He correctly depicted the world as a flattened sphere, but thought Europe, Asia, and North Africa wrapped all the way around it.</seg>
<seg id="14">The “Da Ming Hunyi Tu” was created in China in 1389 on a piece of silk big enough to fill an entire room.</seg>
<seg id="15">Though the mapmakers had never been to Africa, they attempted to depict the continent based on the accounts of the traders who’d been there.</seg>
<seg id="16">Surprisingly, this gave them enough information to create a correctly shaped portrayal of sub-Saharan Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">Beginning in the 15th century, European cartographers began to expand the scope of their world maps as their explorers traveled the world— but not without missteps.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1507, the German cartographer Martin Waldseemuller mapped the Americas— as a thin sliver of land where the east coast would be.</seg>
<seg id="19">Spanish cartographers took a stab at the western side of the Americas based on accounts from an expedition to the Baja Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, the explorers’ impressions of the land led them astray: for over 100 years after, Spanish maps depicted the “Island of California” detached from the rest of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator, best known for his world map, also created a map of the never-before-seen North Pole that was published in 1595.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mercator speculated that the North Pole prominently featured the “Rupes Nigra,” a giant magnetic rock surrounded by a whirlpool that explained why all compasses point north.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even as Europeans built towards a complete picture of the Earth, they didn’t entirely let go of the idea of blank spots filled with mythic beasts.</seg>
<seg id="24">As late as 1657, English scholar Peter Heylin lumped Australia together with Utopia and Fairyland.</seg>
<seg id="25">But with the exception of the North Pole, these so-called terra incognita weren’t really unknown— at least not to the people who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="26">There weren’t really dragons anywhere on Earth, but there were people and cultures— many of them eradicated by those who put their lands on world maps.</seg>
